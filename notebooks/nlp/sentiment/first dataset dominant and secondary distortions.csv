"Since I was about 16 years old I’ve had these “spells” where it’s impossible for me to control my emotions. They come on suddenly and with absolutely no triggers whatsoever, although for hours to days before they happen I’ll sometimes have uncomfortably high levels of energy–I’ll feel either obnoxious and silly (but in a kind of desperate way, if that makes sense) or I’ll be really productive and jittery. Both of these high energy feelings are unsettling, maybe because I normally almost never have high levels of energy. The “spells,” “episodes,” whatever they are, involve extreme guilt and disgust with myself–but it’s a very visceral feeling and it’s overwhelming. I feel trapped inside my disgusting self and like I’m willing to do anything to escape it. I feel incredibly agitated and yet trapped at the same time–like I want to move or do something but I can’t. I also just feel extremely empty and sad–like, I’m filled with this overwhelming emotion but other than that I’m hollow. I feel so desperate and so unhappy and sick and like I hate myself so much–but it’s such a powerful physical feeling that it’s hard to describe with words because it’s a feeling and not a thought. I sob uncontrollably during these episodes (they usually last a few hours although they occasionally last longer) I’ve definitely been suicidal during these periods, but it’s not so much a conscious desire to kill myself than it is a need to escape how I’m feeling. I’m just afraid sometimes that since I’m not really thinking during these times that I might do something to myself–especially since I think during these times that I don’t deserve to get help or that I’m not worth disturbing people by calling them.",I feel trapped inside my disgusting self and like I’m willing to do anything to escape it.I’m just afraid sometimes that since I’m not really thinking during these times that I might do something to myself–especially since I think during these times that I don’t deserve to get help or that I’m not worth disturbing people by calling them.,Labeling,Emotional Reasoning
" So I’ve been dating on and off this guy for almost 3 years. He is 3 years younger than me. During our relationship we had always had issues. First he wouldn’t call me, he would prefer to go out with his friends than me, he wouldn’t even remember the day of our anniversary, or things like that we kind of tried to work all that out but I’ve always felt that he really doesn’t love and care about me, even though he says he loves me. Also he has lied to me during this time, first once he went to a party and when I asked him if he did he lied to me in my face. What bothered me was the fact that he had pictures dancing, almost rubbing himself, with another girl. He lied in my face when I asked! After that we had trust issues and I told him that he would need to help me out to solve that and he said yeah, he would make me trust him again. Months later I found out he is talking to a girl over the internet and he even met her and when I asked him if he knew her he said no again, lie to me in my face looking at my eyes. After that he went away in a trip and disappear for the whole trip without trying to reach me and also told me that his phone didn’t have coverage there, that’s why he didn’t take it…(another lie!) after all that I broke up with him…I think he doesn’t respect me because he is always adding girls on myspace and trying to meet girls…we meet 5 months after we broke up and now he is asking me for a second chance…we had sex once after the breakup, I think he only looks for me whenever he wants to have sex…I still have feelings for him that’s why I always end up accepting whatever he says but I know it is not good… What do I do? Should I give him a second chance or just forget about him? He says he is gonna make it up, that he has change an that now he is more mature but he had lied and hurt me so much that I feel that I love him but I have some anger towards him for making me cry so many times….why do I keep getting back with him every time he does something that hurts me?

"My parents got divorced in 2004. My mother has never recovered, she has severe mood swings, i think she may be bipolar. When I was six years old in 1998, my father moved our family to Germany because he was in the army. I had an amazing childhood. When I was twelve in 2004, my father had to go to Iraq. My mother thought it would be best if she moved my brother and I back to the U.S., where we would have family support. I was very depressed because my dad was my hero and I blamed my mom for everything that went wrong. I felt like no one understood me, mostly because we live in a very remote and rural part of the state. When my dad came back, he wanted a divorce from my mother.

"I don’t really know how to explain the situation, but I deal with a lot of family drama, my parents have kind of high expectations, with the stress of school on top of that I became extremely unhappy and kept all of my emotions in and I wore that fake smile everyday until I finally reached my breaking point. I started self harming for about six months until my mom found out and suggested an inpatient program at a hospital.

"Hello. I have been friend with a guy since grade 6th. We were in the same grade and best pals of each other. Two years back I realized that I love him unconditionally and what all we shared was not merely friendship but I had other feelings for him. First I thought the feelings were mutual and so did all our common friends told me. But when I proposed the GUY, he refused me and said he never felt so. And everybody, including his brother and cousin who are my good friends too, have taken his feelings for me wrongly. He was just a friend to me always and had no such feelings for me. He certainly stopped talking to me. No contacts at all for 8 months. But I still loved him n I still do. I was always concerned about him.

" I have been with my fiancé for two years now. I have gotten along with his family fine up until recently. His mother began emailing jokes to my fiancé and me and we noticed that there were a couple other people on the emails including an ex girlfriend, who he dated for a short period of time. My fiancé asked his mother if she was still in contact with her and she said yes that they email occasionally. He told her that it made him uncomfortable and thought that it was disrespectful to both he and I and that it would hurt my feelings. She responded very harshly by saying she wouldn’t be told who she could talk to. And that if I was that fragile than she would never be close to me any way because she would not want to have a relationship with someone that she needs to sensor what she says because of my feelings. She then deleted me from her email contacts and kept the ex. She said that she would also be a friend with another ex-gf, who had been very rude and nasty to me early on in our relationship, if she was given the chance. I felt like the response was totally irrational, mean and disrespectful. I felt extremely hurt. Her response hurt even more than the actual emailing itself. I had always been very nice and respectful of his mother. My fiancé has been very supportive and says that he would feel just as hurt and uncomfortable if the tables were turned and it were my mother behaving in this manner. All we wanted was for some respect for our feelings. It hurt to see this relationship flaunted in front of me and then to have my future mother in-law blatantly not care less about our feelings and choose to maintain a relationship with the ex and not her future daughter in-law.

"I am a 33 year old with a father who is schizophrenic. He was diagnosed as a young adult but remembers hearing voices as early as the age of 13. He is now in his late fifties and he is beyond caring for himself. The last 4 or 5 living situations he was in (apartments) he was evicted for strange behavior like melting cassette tapes in the oven and starting a minor fire and bothering neighbors , including many other things. He stopped with all hygeine practices. He stopped being able to pay bills do to poor money mangement and lack there of. So he squatted with a few friends all of whom eventually sent him packing not at first realizing the extent of his illness. So after every fallout with his friends whom he has been staying with he ends up at my door with a police escort after they find him wandering the cold streets late at night. I live in a 1 bdrm apartment with my girlfriend and two large dogs. I am not equipped to deal with another person in such confined quarters let alone his illness. As you probably have guessed he refuses medication as well as his illness. He has other health issues that I know nothing about and he will not see a doctor, especially with me present. He has a ventalin inhaler that is prescribed to him that he uses way more than he was origanally suppossed to , along with smoking two + packs of cigarettes a day. He can barely walk ten steps without being seriously out of breath. My father needs help that I can’t give him and all the calls I’ve made trying to find help has come to the same roadblock. Someone can’t be forced treatment. I don’t know what to do. This has been going on for years. This is Saturday and he came via police escort Thursday night just before midnight. I had to call off work Friday because I can’t leave him alone at my apartment in fear he will do something and get me evicted, or worse. I’m at the end of my ropes and don’t know what to do. I can’t just send him out on the streets but it is affecting my happiness and comfort in my home which is very important to me.

" My husband and I have been together for almost 10 years and have one child. We are very openminded and compatible sexually, though our sex life has been through some ups and downs as we have grown as people and experienced child birth and child rearing. The first few years of our relationship, we did some wild things sexually, such as public sex, group sex, voyeurism, etc. We both enjoyed ourselves and were equally involved and responsible for our actions. During and after the pregnancy and birth of our child, however, our sex life went through some drastic changes, and we found ourselves with some sexual issues to work through. One of these issues was my newfound disinterest in our old wild ways; motherhood had turned my viewpoint on it from fun to irresponsible. We have gotten over most of the awkwardness that made its way into our bed, but now we are presented with a somewhat „gray area‰ issue. Over the past year or so, my husband has been visiting sexual video chat sites and broadcasting himself in various sexual states, most of the time masturbating, in both public and private online communications. At first he did this secretly, until I found out in a very startling way; I investigated the website that kept appearing in our computer‚s browser history on my phone at work, and was shocked to find a live public video feed of my husband fully aroused. After some obvious conflict over the discovery, we discussed it, and he told me that he missed having our „wild sex life‰ and that this helps fulfill that need. He asked if I would participate, and I agreed in hopes of helping to satisfy his sexual mentality. We broadcast ourselves having sex online a few times, having up to 1000 people watch, which completely turned my husband on and completely turned me off. I decided I wasn‚t going to join him again due to the uneasy feeling it gave me which kept me from enjoying myself. Ever since, I have known in the back of my mind that he still does this, and have gotten up in the middle of the night a few times to find him masturbating and video chatting publicly or with females who are at least scantily clad, if not nude and masturbating themselves. When I confront him about it, he says he has a public sex fetish and needs to fulfill it, believing that it helps keep him „faithful‰ to me since I am no longer interested. (Something you should know about my husband; he is a popular musician and is often confronted with opportunities for sex at shows, but I am confident that he hasn‚t cheated on me). It is obviously a disturbing experience to get up and find him doing this, and although he is not physically cheating, I still feel hurt and disrespected on these occasions. I basically want an outsider‚s point of view on whether I should accept this as part of the man I fell in love with and married, reject it on the grounds of how I feel (although I have a hard time with the thought of leaving him over it), or if we should try to work out some sort of compromise. I would like to come up with some way where he can feel fulfilled and I can be a part of it, without making me uncomfortable, but haven’t been able to (not asking you to figure out what that would be for me, just mentioning it). Thank you very much for your time and help with this issue.","I decided I wasn‚t going to join him again due to the uneasy feeling it gave me which kept me from enjoying myself.

" I read a question that was similar to the one I have, but I did not believe it could fully be used for my situation. Both my girlfriend and me are 20 years of age. We have been together since July 2nd 2010, and it is March 28th 2011. We were friends for many years before we started dating but due to both of us moving around we were not able to have a relationship. She is everything I ever wanted in a woman and I am so happy to have her in my life. I had no sexual interactions what so ever before I was with her, she is my first in everything. Unfortunately, I am not her first in many things, if anything at all, and that is very hurtful and distressing to me. When she was growing up her parents neglected and even abused her. She was molested on several occasions, but never by a family member. Her life has not been one of happiness and is full of past pains that plague her to this day. She never felt loved or cared about by anyone, and sought out relationships to fill this void. Her first sexual experience was with a female, they were friends and one night during a sleep over her friend put her hand down my girlfriends pants and began feeling around down there. My girlfriend said she did it back to her friend. She was bisexual for a while and dated a few girls, but never did anything for that kiss them. Though not often she claims. Her first sexual experience with a boyfriend was when she was 14 and the guy she was dating asked her to “touch him”, and so she did. She says she didn’t want to but did it to make him happy. In her next relationship she let him suck on her breasts and finger her, she touched him but while he had pants on so there was no contact with his penis. In her third relationship she also let him finger her and she gave him a hand job as well. In her last relationship she went out with this guy for 2.5 years and she really loved him. He was the first she gave oral sex to, and they did everything together. He fingered her; she gave him many hand jobs and lots of oral sex. She wanted to have sex and so did he, but she brought it up to him. They agreed and she claims that he only penetrated her a little bit before finishing, so she doesn’t believe she lost her virginity. He claims that every time they tried, which both him and her say was 3 times, that they had full intercourse but she swears that after that first time having failed, and the other two times they never got past being naked, none of the times they ever had full intercourse. I don’t know if she’s trying to protect me because she knows how bad it would hurt me if they actually did, or if she really didn’t have full on sex with him. I know her was able to penetrate her at least somewhat so I also have issues with whether she was still a virgin the first time we had sex.","I don’t know if she’s trying to protect me because she knows how bad it would hurt me if they actually did, or if she really didn’t have full on sex with him.",Mind Reading,

" I have been dating this guy for about three months now. In the beginning of our relationship, everything was perfect and I trusted him whole-heartedly. Up until recently I’ve been very suspicious and my trust just keeps going down. I started to lose trust when finding a text message in his phone from someone calling him “babe” on Valentines Day. He said it was nothing like that, and I asked to see the rest of the messages from that person but he said no because he thought that would change the dynamics of our relationship and that I am supposed to just trust him, so I let it go. Ever since that occasion it’s been so hard for me to trust him like I did in the beginning. He’s constantly texting some person in his phone and I’m 99% sure it is a female, which does not bother me. But what does bother me is that for some reason I have this gut instinct that this female he is constantly texting is someone he is involved with. When I sit and ponder on that idea I think to myself, “He doesn’t even have time to spend with other women, he’s always so busy.” But I almost feel like I’m convincing myself because I just have this feeling inside. On top of all of this my mother and a few of my close friends don’t really trust this guy or particularly care for him too which makes it even harder for me as well. I’m wondering how you feel about this situation? Should I end this relationship before I get hurt or wait it out and see if it can really become as good as I thought it could?","everything was perfect and I trusted him whole-heartedly.

"As I’ve been becoming older, I’ve been getting into arguments with my parents. But recently they’ve been happening more and more frequently and I’ve been getting more and more angry each time. Each argument has been about the same major topics: my behavior towards my siblings or how I “disrespect” my parents. But sometimes I can’t help what I say to my parents. If they’re in my face yelling about what I just said or how I forgot to do something, how can I not yell back? My parents say its disrespect, but I feel that they have no respect for me when they’re yelling in my face. But the topic we argue most about is my little brother. He’s 7 and if I do the slightest thing to him he goes and tells and I get the whole “you’re older and need to grow up speech”. I’m sick of it. I feel that they can’t see that my little brother does things that really bother me, and I’m not being dramatic. Like today, my little brother does this thing where he just touches me. I HATE when he does this because it’s COMPLETELY unnecessary. So I hit him back, not that hard just a slap in the arm. Just so happens my dad was walking by at the same exact time. When he saw this he immediately got in my face, hit my arm (and I had to fight back the urge to hit my dad right back), and started giving me a speech (which during I was completely being a smart aleck because I felt this whole thing was not my fault). When my mother got home I got the same speech from her, but she just didn’t understand how I felt! Then while I was in the room right next to the kitchen they started to discuss what they should do to that “devil”. But my defense is that my little brother is just very dumb and a wimp and that my parents baby him too much. But to avoid these confrontations I feel the only way to do this is to COMPLETELY IGNORE my whole family. I’ve been doing this by sleeping all day and my schoolwork is suffering, I also barely eat because of sleeping all day. But these arguments always seem to find their way into my life. Is there any way to get my parents to understand me? How do I deal with 7-year-old brother? Can I just keep ignoring them? Please do not treat his as a teenager being dramatic, this is a serious cry for help. After some of these arguments I’ve hurt myself. I scratched my arm with tweezers and today I dug my own nails into my arm. Some of these arguments have resulted in me almost getting smacked in the face by my dad. I’ve also cried for hours before. So please I’m begging for help.","But sometimes I can’t help what I say to my parents. If they’re in my face yelling about what I just said or how I forgot to do something, how can I not yell back?

He was lying to me. He was buying secret phones to call this “girl”. He insulted me,said things to me that one would not even say to their worst enemy. Once he had to go to the hospital.

"For the past two and a half years I’ve had problems with depression–it’s been mostly episodic although not entirely. My junior year of high school I was depressed (sad, apathetic, irritable, indecisive, guilty, empty, having nausea and headaches)on and off, but in addition to the general feelings of “low mood” I’d have these brief episodes of extreme dysphoria– I was really agitated and felt desperate and hopeless and suicidal and empty and hollow. They lasted a few hours, and there was no trigger of any kind. The next year I didn’t have any of these episodes but had general depressive symptoms on and off. Over the summer before heading to college, I had a pretty severe panic attack, because I was experiencing chest pain and was afraid I was having a heart attack. I’d never had a panic attack before, and I went to the ER. I had an EKG and bloodwork, which was all fine, but after the panic attack I experienced extreme hypochondriacal anxiety and depersonalization for about a month. I also developed visual snow, which hasn’t gone away. I’ve been hypervigilant ever since the panic attack, and when I went to college the hypochondria came back and stayed for about a month and a half.","My junior year of high school I was depressed (sad, apathetic, irritable, indecisive, guilty, empty, having nausea and headaches)on and off, but in addition to the general feelings of “low mood” I’d have these brief episodes of extreme dysphoria– I was really agitated and felt desperate and hopeless and suicidal and empty and hollow.I’ve been hypervigilant ever since the panic attack, and when I went to college the hypochondria came back and stayed for about a month and a half.",Labeling,

"This is all probably going to sound really strange, but I just really feel like something is not right. There is a blur in my life that I absolutely cannot remember. I can remember right before I started school, when I was 4 or 5. Then there is about 2 or 3 years that is completely lost. I have never though much about until here of late. It all centers around a place that me and my family stayed. It was a duplex and I don’t remember living there at all. I remember that house before that and the one after. The first memory I have of the house we lived in after the duplex is me and my older brother “exploring ourselves”. It was more then a “you show me yours and I’ll show you mine.” I feel so ashamed about that and cannot figure out for the life of me WHY we did that?? I can remember touching my stuffed animals in inappropriate places and even doing the same things with another girl that was my age. I started having sex at a very early age, around 12, and haven’t stopped since. In fact, that is really the only risk taking behavior I have ever really had. From somewhere, and I don’t know where, it has been imprinted on my mind that if you care someone, that’s how you show it. I have never had any other experiences with my brother since that very young age, but I know that we did it more then once. I am just wondering were all this was coming from. I recently started having dreams of my brother and me now. I know, it sounds sick, but I can’t help it. This is also something that we have never talked about since it happened. I have also been having like these flashbacks of this man that used to come to the house that I don’t remember living in. (I know he was there from what my brothers have told me) In the scenarios, I am a little girl, around 5,6 or 7. I am yelling for my daddy, (my parents were separated at the time we lived in this house also) and a man in a police uniform, tucking me into bed and telling me to quit yelling and the he loved me and putting his hand over my mouth. I started to investigate this man and he was arrested in 2001 for 7 counts of indecent liberties with a minor spanning from 1976 to 2001. The accusers were girls that he babysat for other women and his daughter. I am just wondering if maybe my mind has blocked out the span of those years for a reason. Is that possible?? Is that why me and brother were “exploring” each other?? It would in fact explain a lot of my behavior. I have anxiety issues now, but I to scared to see a therapist.

"I know there have been many in my situation, but I have yet to find a submission that has presented a clear answer to help with my situation. In October 2009 my wife found out I was cheating with a co-worker. I did not feel comfortable telling her all of the details at first so I continued lying as I felt I was protecting her already fragile state. I have been a liar since I can remember and I don’t know how to stop. I realize I personally make the decision to lie every time I do it, but that doesn’t seem to get in the way when it comes down to making a decision whether or not to lie. We have severe financial problems and will more than likely lose our home. My wife has told me we won’t be married after she graduates from nursing school but we haven’t separated yet because we have 3 children together and she doesn’t have an income. I have been getting payday loans to subsidize my income and have paid a significant amount towards those loans to keep things as normal as possible for the kids. So goes the lying. I get loans my wife doesn’t know about to keep things normal and she always finds out I have been getting money somewhere and I end up telling her the truth. She says I am childish for always lying and adds what I’ve done to the list of reasons we are getting divorced. I told her tonight I fear for my life sometimes because she doesn’t seem to have control over herself when she is in a fit of rage over what I’ve done. She has made comments in the past that she would “stab me” and she would “get off” if she were to kill me (because I cheated). I know what I did to her was terrible and I feel like a terrible person every day. I live in a manic world to keep myself from going off the deep end. I have been told I can’t leave my house because I will be abandoning my children and the courts will not award any custody to me if I do. She, however, wants me to leave immediately. I told her about my fear and she got extremely angry, told me I was selfish and started crying because that statement meant I didn’t care about what I put her through. The fact is, I didn’t know how to help her. I let myself get in the way a lot since she found out and she wouldn’t let me provide comfort when she was in pain. I have never, nor will I ever inflict harm on her, but I fear her statement are true and the mental anguish I have caused is the reason she cut herself some this past year and almost overdosed on drugs. I am writing this because I want to stop lying. I am writing this because I want to know how to get out of the situation I am in without a huge legal mess. I love my kids; I love to be around them.

I diddnt succeed and i ended up eating so much i gained 10 of the 20 lbs i lost and then over summer after i got diagnose with celiacs disease i diddnt eat very much, there would be days i just skipped food all together. everyday at the pool more and more guys would look and I felt more confident. when i went to my doctor for my celiacs doctor about a month ago, she said that my weight concerned her. apparently 140 is the lowest my body can be without being unhelthy and i weighed in at 142. I still didnt feel it was enough and about 2 weeks ago i discovered that if i take my adhd medicine everyother day not only can i slack off when i really want to but i get sick and then im not hungry. I went down to 140.2 for about 4 days and i felt like a fat kid. In gym I couldnt run as fast as normal and i was out of breath in no time, when we got back i looked in the mirror and saw how gross i looked. my boyfriend thinks im self destructive in ways other that not eating because he sees me eating apples and rice bars alot and thinks its the only healthy thing i do for my body since i stopped cutting.But he dosnt understand either way and dosnt seem to notice either way so i figure hes happy about thedirection of my figure. I couldnt get my meds to make me sick anymore last week so i stopped taking them and i just ate everything with sugar or chocolate or fat and went up to 147 and it freaked me out. Christmas eve i took my meds without thinking and like usual when i take hem i diddnt eat. a few hours later i got really sick but due to a childhood surgery im unable to vomit so i just dryheave and it hurts but im used to it. I diddnt eat untill christmas morning(yesterday) and i ate all day long. then thismorning i did my usual. I got in my yogapants and a bra and ran down to weigh myself. unhappy with being almost 5 lbs above goal i got off and looked in the mirror again. poking and pulling and shaking i decided that i need to get back down but mom handed me a bowl of oatmeal that im currently avoiding and thinking about flushing even tho im starving so i think ill take my meds again tomorrow so ill be at my goal before mybirthday on the 29th and then ill beable to decide if i need to loose more or not. i realise this cant benormal. making myself sick to avoid food instead of making myself purge it and actually eating so is it really an eating dissorder if i take vitamins to get my minerals and then skip a day here and there for food but i never actually purge it?if so how do i fix myself, im too scared to tell my councellor because she thinks ive made so much progress wih everything else i dont want to dissapoint her and shed probably want me to tell mom who would make me eat at the table again so she knows im eating… I want to be in the fashion and art world and food just makes me fat… not fashionable nor artistic but disgusting and lathargic and even with crunches and dieting i cant seem to look the way i want … i also feel that im unhelthy weight already because the chart for weight is based off hight and im prety sur my chest is probably about 15 or 20 lbs of my weight wich means id be at unhelthy weight already wouldnt it? I just stil dont like the way i lok tho please help me figure this out","if so how do i fix myself, im too scared to tell my councellor because she thinks ive made so much progress wih everything else i dont want to dissapoint her and shed probably want me to tell mom who would make me eat at the table again so she knows im eating",Mind Reading,
"…a little crazy and totally lost: I’m 17 and for the past 3 months I’ve been feeling really down. I’ve no real reason to be, I’m a full time student with a good part time job, a loving boyfriend, a great family and have been getting good marks at university. However, lately I’ve been feeling really lost. I’ve been having mood swings- I often find I’m either on a really high or low, usually low mood, and that this changes quickly. I’ve also been feeling very irritable, and have found myself snapping at my family for no apparent reason. I’ve been on the contraceptive pill since October, and I was wondering if this could be some kind of hormone excess? I’m really not sure. I’m also crying frequently and feel like I’ve got no real passion or talent for any of the things I used to be interested in. At times I really do feel like I’m going crazy and I also feel that I can’t really talk to anyone about this because they’ll either think I’m being attention seeking or overly dramatic, however I don’t think either of these things are true and I do generally feel like I’m totally lost with finding a solution to this problem.

" I have had depression for 3 years. I started taking zoloft 75mg and I was able to come out of depression after a year and half. I eventually weaned myself off of zoloft in april 2010 because I always felt severe fatigue when I was taking it which caused me to feel even more depressed. I have felt pretty good without the meds but here latley I am back to crying for no reason and only able to think about what needs to be done instead of doing it. I feel very overwhelmed when I go to do anything, so I just stay on the couch and do nothing. I feel very irritable when I do have to get up to do anything, and not being able to do anything has been with me since my depression started pretty much.

"My friend died earlier 2011 of suicide; only a few months into the year as a matter of fact. I met her in September 2009 my senior year of High School, and spent time with her every day or every other day, for varying lengths of the day (sometimes a whole class -we had gym for the first half of that school year- and some 5 minute periods before and after the last class, sometimes only those 5 minute periods). We also saw each other at dances and such. And we became close friends, and I eventually considered her a best friend. And, as a matter of fact, had feelings for her beyond friends. We hung out together throughout my Senior year, though it became less in the second half the year (we no longer had gym the second half, though we still met before and after the last two classes of the day with our group of friends, and eventually that half of the year I went to her lunch period to spend time). I took this girl to prom (though nothing intimate occurred as we were not dating), was with her at 3 graduation parties (one being my own), and a few other event though not more than maybe 2. Once I graduated was when we steadily stopped seeing each other. I kept in touch on Facebook, and Texted what I thought at the time was quite a lot (I believe it was once a week or once every two weeks at least), but whenever I asked to hangout, they were always busy. I still considered her close and important friend for all that happened in that year I knew her, because we had gotten very close. This period after we stopped seeing one another at all is the Fall and Winter of 2010.

We are able to talk about any subject and have lots of fun and what appears to be a deep connection – we talk about serious subjects, philosophies, growth, the meaning of life, etc. It’s very engaging. This goes on for a few months and then suddenly he turns “off.” One day I wake up and we are not connecting at the “normal” pace (i.e daily phone calls, a few texts, or plans for in person contact). The connection feels severed, there is an edge in his voice, and he is cold. I notice this, give it some space (2-3 days) and then intentionally and gently bring it up. Initially he is defensive but pretty quickly he will acknowledge that yes, he’s withdrawn and eventually some narrative will show up as a reason for the behavior – he felt I disrespected him (I was late returning a call), he felt I abandoned him (I had some trips and so I was out of town), he was nervous that I’d reject some of his behavior that he’d been hiding (he smokes occasionally), etc. The conversations come back on line and we talk about his feelings, needs, and better ways to communicate etc. He does have a therapist and I suggest he work on these issues with his therapist. Then everything goes back to normal until it cycles again.",,No Distortion,
"I’m quickly destabilizing my mood has gotten uncontrollable, I’ve talked to my therapist/clinician or whatever and they said they would keep me where I’m at as far as medication goes. I was in a psychiatric hospital months back and they had me on three different medications and I felt kinda good, but now I’m just on a 1 mg risperidone, and it doesn’t do anything anymore. I was on lithium, ativan, and seroquel, before I had a mental breakdown and over dosed before they took me off the medication. I really feel the need to be back on an anti-anxiety, and mood stabilizer, maybe even anti-depressant.

"I have been in a relationship with my best friend for five years. We are a great fit in all ways, but he frequently questions my integrity and his self-worth. A few years ago, I took a high paying job as a personal assistant. We were living in a bad neighborhood and I jumped at the opportunity to make more money- without questioning the logistics. It ended up being a personal assistant to a pimp, arranging dates, managing money, and sending out ads for the girls. We talked about what my job would entail, and he was not happy with it, but agreed that we needed the money and it wouldn’t be forever. A few months after I started, my boss forced me to do something not in my job description. In the situation, I feared for my life, so I obliged. I didn’t show up for my shift the next day, hoping it would all just go away and I could find a different job quickly. I started receiving threatening phone calls. My boss demanded all the money he had paid me back ($20,000). He had a copy of my ID and social from the hiring process. He made it very clear that my life was in his hands. I worked as a sex worker for a year and a half to pay him back in full. During that time, my boyfriend found out about it and understandably flipped out. Our marriage plans went out the window, I was forced out of our friend group, and was left to deal with the aftermath alone. That was two years ago, and we are in a much better place now. But for him, marriage still isn’t on the table and his friends haven’t welcomed me back. He says that he often blames himself for not figuring it out sooner, and blames me for not coming to him for help. I try to explain to him that I was scared to involve anyone else for fear of what would happen to them, but he just doesn’t understand why I didn’t go to the cops. I’m afraid this occurrence will always be a stain on my relationship resume with him, and that he will only see his pain of feeling betrayed and cheated on, when that was not my intention. Can we work towards forgiveness? Or am I wasting my time?

"I’m spiraling into this state of despair because I cannot enjoy what is around me. The birds, the trees, the sky, the smile of people, nothing. It brings no joy to me and it really bothers me. However, I understand that no human can live this wonderful life all of the time and be scott free without seeing some things that bother them. In my case, I’ve seen some very horrible things, mostly car accidents and family members who have died from various diseases and being mortified and shocked at them having no life anymore. I’m very sensitive to such things as well and it effects me more than anyone else I know and it bothers me. Even a dead deer on the side of the road traumatizes me for the day or seeing some zombies. One particular day, however, sealed the deal with me being pretty much traumatized constantly. So I’m 13 years old and I’m going to a doctor’s appointment and I see an old man with his skull crushed in and the insides of his head splattered all over the highway from a Semi hitting him in his car. Imagine how mortified I was. I didn’t speak for a whole day as a matter of fact and I cried the whole night. That perhaps sealed the deal with me being shocked. So fast forward to me being 20 now and I’m upset that I can’t be happy because I am in this constant state of shock and I do these thousand yard stares yet think and feel nothing because I’ve seen what horrors the world has offered. I can’t be happy at all. I ask God to help me but my mental capacity does not allocate me to register that there is innocence around me and that I should smile because my innocence and happiness has been permanently stolen from me and I am in a constant state of shock and I feel “out of the world”.

"My brother’s always been a shy child, but he had a good relationship with family and friends. In his teenage years, he started to withdraw. I was the only one to whom he kept talking. He began to spend most of the day in his bedroom. He also began to use monosyllable words to reply to my parents, aunts, cousins… Never started a conversation unless you addressed him. Now, at 19 (almost 20), it has evolved to the point he doesn’t talk to anybody, not even to me, and not even with monosyllables. He doesn’t look anybody in the face either (he didn’t do that a few years ago). If I try to talk to him, he ignores me or makes a sound of annoyance and kicks me out of his bedroom. He is very childish too, in the sense that it is part of his routine to watch cartoons with his favorite stuffed toys (he refuses to throw toys away). He prefers their company to that of people. I don’t even know if he has friends. He certainly avoids his college peers. He has dinner alone and goes to sleep early (I bet it is only to avoid us too). He only goes out if he needs to get a book in the library or if he has to go to college. Otherwise, you’ll find him home. Is he afraid to become an adult? Could that be the reason he behaves like a child despite being almost 20? Could he have social anxiety? Autism, even? Maybe Aspergers. Some symptoms coincide: • Difficulty to socialize and make friends; isolation • Rigid routines (he gets distressed if he can’t follow them) • Fear of change (he doesn’t want to throw old/broken things away) • Hygiene issues (he rarely showers and shaves and he never uses deodorant) • Sensitivity to noises and light • Repetitive motor mannerisms (which he didn’t have as a child) If he had autism, though, he would have some speech difficulties, wouldn’t he? He actually uses sarcasm and understands it perfectly. Never shown any speech delay either. Besides, I think I read someone is born autistic, so he can’t become autistic at the age of 18. It’s been an evolution, that’s why I’m not sure what is going on. Is he just a very immature teenager or does he have a condition? (From Spain)",,No Distortion,
"I’m writing for my brother who is currently 26. I am his older brother. I have been concerned about him for a long time. Growing up he had few friends and would mainly play video games by himself or online. Also growing up he was a bit bossy towards my parents and others, he was the youngest child. In college he had a short phase where he was a bit more social. It is now about 4 years since he has graduated college. In that time he has not worked any job. He gets angry when people try to tell him to think about the future and what he wants to do with his life. He lives alone in an apartment that my parents own in Queens (we live on Long Island). He barely goes outside. He orders things to his apartment, even food so he doesnt go outside (he doesn’t know how to drive either). He mainly just plays video games online and sleeps. It seems like he has some hidden form of cash flow that we do not know of since he buys himself things on Amazon quite frequently. He is extremely moody and can get in quite negative angry moods towards others. This has been 4 years and I am not sure what to do. He himself does not seem open for us trying to help, when my parents try to have a more serious talk with him he gets extremely angry and then will say extreme things to get them to stop talking, like “This will be the last you will ever see me. I will move to Sweden” (he is currently dating a girl online from Sweden who has recently come to visit him in NY).

"Hi, first some information to myself. I am a very planning person and hate uncertainty and feel a high degree of responsibility for my family. I also was always afraid of death and therefore also of cancer, heart attacks also. Now I had a panic attack 3 months ago that kicked off thoughts and high fear of suicide. I was so afraid that u went straight to a psychological clinic where I was diagnosed with OCD and a panic disorder. I am lucky, not afraid of driving or knives or anything like that because I really don’t want to die so I don’t think I am a risk for myself. But that now first kicked off the huge fear of a major depression that could change my attitude one day towards the fact that I don’t want to die. Luckily I could also reassure myself that I don’t have depression because I don’t really show any symptoms like listlessness or loss of happiness in activities. I also still see my friends a lot. But I somehow still are very sensitive towards my emotions and anything around me that sound like death depression, sadness, suicide or stuff like that. That stuff scares me. For example, when somebody is making a joke about me I instantly check myself to make sure I am not sad or mad or anything. That goes along with a lot of ruminations about the topics of OCD, suicide, anxiety and psychological disorders itself. I also sometimes have the feeling of derealization when I feel anxious and insecure. And since some days the fear of becoming schizophrenic or psychotic came up heavily. I don’t have any hallucinations or hear anything that isn’t there but the occasional surreal feeling of the world around me freaks me out. I am so scared that I could harm myself in psychosis.

"I was married 36 years to my soulmate. Our relationship wasn’t perfect but we were perfect for each other. His death was due to very critical health problems that resulted in 100 days in a hospital that ended with a massive heart attack in the hospital. I was with him when he passed. My concern is where are all the people who were there for me prior? Why do friends stop calling, etc. Prior to all this, I had a fairly good social life. However I always seemed to be the one reaching out, making dinner dates, planning get togethers. I do work full time and was my husbands caregiver for awhile, but I always made sure I made time for my friends. Now that I am alone, nobody ever reaches out, still. You would think they would realize I lost the love of my life and reach out to me. Make sure I am ok, invite me to lunch. I can count on one hand the number of friends who have checked on me. Is losing friends normal during grief? I mean even my husbands old friends, the guy who did the funeral ( a longtime friend), even my husbands family! (out of his 4 siblings, 1 has reached out) I spend a lot of time alone. I work, spend lots of time with my grandkids, but as far as a social life, its almost nothing. Part of me is angry that here I am going thru the worst thing I’ve ever experienced and where are the people who came to the funeral, said they are there for me? Why NOW is it still up to me to be the initiator? I am doing ok with the grieving process and have made great progress in the last 12 months, except for THIS. Even some co-workers ignore the situation, my own boss doesn’t even ask how I am, ever. Not once since the funeral. (I love my job and have been at my job 31 years.

She always dismissed it saying that he was drunk, but I could tell she still resented him and was very scared of him. She assured me that he never really hit her anymore but recently she would come to school with cuts on her face. When I asked her about it all she said was that she had been missing school because she was sick and her stepdad hated when she missed school. I was immediately concerned and considered reporting it but I knew my friend was scared that if the abuse was reported that she would get taken away from her mom and have to live with her dad in Florida. She hates her dad so much that she would rather ive with her abusive stapdad and she insist that her real dad is not fit to take care of here.

"I was fine until 7th grade ended, and then its like my memory jump skips to constantly being worried and miserable. When I was going through 8th grade I reached a point were I decided to work on what was bothering me so I could be better, but thats when I realized I had no idea what was bothering me. Looking back before all of this started though I’m not sure if I ever was fine, when I was younger I never considered any other kids to be my friend really, a lot of adults though. I did eventually move to a place were I kinda grew comfortable with everyone, and while I used to consider that time to be the peak of my life, looking back there were still flags then to. Im not exactly sure when, but between 2nd and 5th grade I developed maladaptive daydreaming, and while I felt fine for some reason little me felt compelled to feel emotional pain, I used to purposefully seek out depressing content to put myself in a bad mood, I honestly still kind of do this. During this time I developed a crush in which I became obsessively and honestly kind of creepily attached to him which drove him away from me in the long run,(this repeated in 7th). Anyways after 5th grade I moved away from that place to somewhere else, I got adjusted and made new friends and everything seemed fine until 7th grade ended. Going into 8th I originally had hope, I hoped I go back and I’d fall back into the old groove of things and everything would be fine, but when I got back it was just more issues. I didn’t trust anyone, every time I was with my friends I just felt alone, and I figured they probably wanted me gone so they could actually have a good time. My anxiety, (that was previously nonexistent), was at its peak, i’d have shooting pains, hypnic jerks, and would frequently fall into states of depersonalization/derealization. I finally came to the conclusion that the way to stop hurting, was to stop caring. I’d repeatedly tell myself, “I don’t care about anything, I don’t care about anyone”, in hopes that I would believe it, I’m not sure if that had any effect on me, but after 8th grade ended I just stopped caring. I still had symptoms of anxiety and depression, but they were no longer manifesting themselves into physical symptoms. I still felt unwanted by my group of friends so I just stopped hanging out with them. I wouldn’t say I felt happy, but I wasn’t miserable, I was just kind of done I think. Going into high school I still didn’t really have any friends because I was to scared to talk to anyone, and when they made an effort to talk to me, all I could think in response to there advances were one word answers. I started to grow more fearful of the future as I realized that my childhood was running out and I had no idea what I want to do with my life. I know people say “pursue a career in your interests” but nothing interests me. If I could truly do anything in life, I’d find a secluded area from everyone so I could listen to music and be alone to my fantasy world. I guess that’s kind of were i am now, done, and fearful of the future. I can recognize that not all my thoughts are correct and 90% of the bad things that im convinced everyone feels about me, are probably caused by my anxiety, but even being actively aware of that I still don’t feel any different. I just hope that someday I can be normal, I fear that all I’ll have to remember my teenage years, is me sitting alone in my room listening to music. I wish I could go to social outings and take risks, and have new experiences, and I realize for that to happen I have to take the initiative, but everytime I get handed a chance to do those things I shy away from them because in the moment that all sounds like a terrible idea to me because I much rather be left alone, and its not until later that I regret it.

"I recently had a dream which was a small part of a bigger series of unrelated dreams, in which I was at the home of my grandmother and I saw a picture of me as a child (I remember thinking I was 2 years old or something) and my (currently deceased, but he would’ve been alive then) grandfather. In the picture, I think it was a moving picture, he put his tongue in my mouth and was tongue kissing me. I didn”t notice this at first and once I did I was alarmed and confused but I didn”t say anything outright, I just kept trying to figure out what year that photo was taken because I was sure I was two in the picture. My grandmother and my father looked at the back of the photo and tried to find what date it was taken. Neither seemed to see or acknowledge what I was seeing and were even trying to somewhat distract me with trivial things, though I don”t know if that was intentional or not. We couldn”t find the date and they were unconcerned. I remember immediately thinking when I saw my grandfather kiss me that it was molestation, that I was witnessing myself being molested as a child and that it was wrong ; but I didn”t really make a big deal out of it. Even though I was alarmed to see it because it was both so out of character for my grandfather and so wrong/disgusting beyond that I didn”t really feel anything. A little disbelief maybe. After not being able to find the date I allowed the rest of my paternal family to distract me and didn”t bring it up again or care. In fact I went on to have a completely unrelated dream and when I woke up I remembered thinking every dream except that one was significant only to realize later on that I had seen something incredibly disturbing but again with no big reaction. Not my sister nor my mom nor any maternal family members were in the dream. It was only one dream and I just had it, but I was wondering if this is an indication that I was actually molested as a child?

"Hi, I have been with my partner for nearly 3 years and we have been through a lot. I forgave him at the beginning of the relationship when I found out he cheated on me, but I have never managed to rebuild the trust.

"Hello. I developed a crush on a celebrity when I was 10 and it has grown into an obsession that I can’t stop (I’m 23 now). I’ve been diagnosed with generalised anxiety and have had depression in the past linked to poor self-image/esteem. My family relationships are good. I’ve had two relationships, one when 13 and the second when 15. The first time I was used by him and for 3 years until I got over him, whenever he was dating someone I would try hard to look like them (hair/makeup/clothes etc.). The second was emotionally abusive but I broke-up after a month and never wanted to reconcile. I thought about this celebrity less while in relationships but never fully stopped. Since my teen years I’ve fantasised about them: being in a relationship, conversing with them, being intimate (sexually) etc. When in a relationship with another female celebrity I became obsessed with her and still am, saving hundreds of pictures of her, watching all the interviews I could because I wanted to act, sound and look like her, eat, exercise and use the same beauty products as her if I could find that information. Whenever seeing pictures of them I feel a painful pit in my stomach. I would follow pages on instagram that followed them. After they broke up I stayed obsessed, less than initially but still, focusing more on whoever he’s currently with/dating (he’s with a regular girl now). I’ve tried to pursue his interests (e.g. art and watch the same TV shows) and also more recently tried to even use the same products and dress the same way he does if I can find that info (But I don’t want to be a man). I’m seeing a clinical psych and she said she’s unsure and to just avoid checking their social media (tried many times and even after over a month of abstaining from all social media it never worked). I’ve tried journaling, meditating, talking to friends and some things help a little but not much. I can barely differentiate what I like and what him/his girlfriends like. I can’t concentrate for a few minutes without them popping in my head even when I don’t want them to. Avoiding doesn’t help and I don’t want to, nor replace it by forcing myself in a relationship.

"I come from a broken home. My mother was a serial adulterer with various major mental issues, and my father is a bitter man. My younger sister has some major issues as well and is abusive to both me and my father. Despite this, he seems to prefer her more. He is a pretty unemotional man by nature, but he is always talking with her and they have a lot of fun. He mentors her gently and speaks very kindly to her. She’s very mean to him, telling him to go and kill himself and has physically attacked both of us in the past, but he still adores her. I’ve always tried to be a good kid and played mediator between my parents when they were divorcing. I’ve gotten good grades, helped around the house, and even got accepted into a top university with a generous grant.

"Hey, I’ve been really struggling because I’ve been thinking about this problem a lot. So a quick background story. I am the oldest in 5 kids and my parents were married for over 15 years. I also come from a middle eastern background and a very strict religious family. So I’m not sure if anyone is going to understand how hard it is to say anything to anyone. So my dad was sick since 2011 he had a stroke that made him paralyzed on his whole left side. I was around 9 years old when he started being sick. My mom would always take care of him and stay by his side or at least that’s what I thought. But when I was 11, I started seeing my mom talk to different guy on the phone and always flirting with him. I was young and I told her mom are you talking to anyone else. But she denied it and then changed the password for her phone so I wouldn’t look at anything. I ignored it for about a year or so, now around this time, my dad was getting better and the relationship between them was great, there weren’t any problems and we almost never saw them fighting, but I still heard her talking to that guy and saw her many times meet with him when my dad wasn’t home and she always thought I didn’t know and I forgot about it. Time passed and I always ignored, I never told anything to any of my other siblings or faced her with it again. Time passed and my dad got sick again, and she was still talking to that guy in addition to 2 other guys that I knew about and they looked a lot younger than her. I would always find a way to know her password and open her chats to see all the flirty messages between her and the other guys. I always cried by myself and kept it in me since then. Speed up to two years ago, I was 14 at that time, my dad got another stroke and was really sick, he passed away. My mom continued to talk to one of the guys and I don’t know what happened to the other two. I regret not telling my dad anything. And if anyone of my uncles knows about her texts and the pictures she sends to that guy, they will kill her because it is against our religion and our culture and they are very strict. I always cry and I still look thru her phone and see all the disgusting things she says and sends to that guy. I don’t know if I should tell anyone or keep it a secret still. Oh, I forgot to mention that the guy she’s still talking is also married and has kids.(From the USA)","And if anyone of my uncles knows about her texts and the pictures she sends to that guy, they will kill her because it is against our religion and our culture and they are very strict.

"For the past couple of months, the relationship with my mother has started to fall apart, due to a lie I told back in February , which I took full responsibility for and I am aware that hiding my depression from her and the fact that I was seeing a physiologist without her knowing was not okay, but I felt as if she wouldn’t understand, because she’s always told me I make a big deal out of everything and that I want to make it seem like I’m a victim when I cry, so I was ashamed to tell her and face her criticism. As of lately I have returned with my ex boyfriend, we separated previously about a month ago because I wanted time to focus on myself and When we argued it was very hard on me because I was at a vulnerable stage, Due to me being sensitive my mother would see me cry and she would immediately assume that my boyfriend was at fault, she assumes it was because of him that I fell depressed and she assumed that because of him I chose to take a break from school to better my mental health. Now that I am back with him, she blames me every single day for choosing to ruin my life, she blames me for causing her pain and she blames me for my family falling apart. It’s gotten to the point where I’m scared to go home due to the criticism I’ll have to face from her.

But our family dynamics were already weird he moved when I was 3 so never really had a relationship anyway. It really hit my mum I guess as her parents had both died within the last year and she took it hard and i feel like she got quite sad. It was already tense that he didn’t want to go to the funeral, due to different religions. Then she found out about a month after her dad died that he was cheating. I was the one that discovered it by text anyway and I told her. Everything’s been a mess now and she’s changed so much. We used to be relatively close and in the first few months she was just always angry at me or crying because of him and since my brothers went to university it’s just been me and her. It feels like she’s so codependent on me and I can’t turn her away cause she’s my mum and that’s not me but it’s hard because I can barely deal with my own problems (depression). Now although it’s been a few months it just feels horrible all she’ll talk about is that other woman, whom she just follows around on social media and my dad. Everyone’s told her to just leave him but she won’t say that people told her it’ll affect us, but it really won’t it’d just be better really.

"I know the site has many articles on this but I feel like it may be different somehow. I have had homicidal thoughts from a young age, I am 14 now, but just about two months ago they started to become very common and sometimes intrusive, or at least more than before. I was hospitalized for suicide attempts and excessive self-harm in March so some people think this may be the cause of it. These thoughts are not disturbing to me, rather I enjoy them. I think of things like abusing people, what it would be like to drive something through someone’s skin, watching people bleed or beg. I have also been just grabbing different things when I am alone that seem sharp and just driving them into whatever material is near me. It gives me an adrenaline rush similar to what I would experience whilst self-harming. I believe it could be due to withdrawal from self-harm so these thoughts are sort of like a substitute, but I might just be lying to myself. I have always experienced this but I thought it was something everyone had until recently so this makes me think that it might be less than what I am making it out to be for some reason. I feel as if I am lying to myself and I am only telling myself that I am homicidal just because. I do not trust others and I do not trust myself so a lot of the time I feel as if I am not mentally ill and only making it up. My therapist tells me this is not the case but I continue thinking I am only making things up. So I am conflicted as to whether these thoughts are real or not and I am just acting like it. When I was younger I used to only think about killing specific people, but it can be anyone now.

"Recently I have been consumed by certain fantasies and lack of empathy. When I see people in the street I wonder what it would be like to kill them(mostly out of boredom), and I have thought of ways I would do it – I’m particularly intrigued by poison or psychologically engineering a suicide because it’s quite passive(not violent/bloody). However, I don’t think I would ever do anything to hurt anyone, to be honest, I think 1) out of laziness and 2) I would want to be 100% sure I would get away with it. I’m an INTJ personality so I am meticulously organized and analytical. I have recently been very withdrawn socially and realized my relationships with people/conversations are quite superficial and I do it just because I sometimes need friends. However, while I feel like I can switch my empathy ‘off’ (stop caring), I do care very deeply for some people, and I love helping my loved ones and making their lives better.

"From the U.S.:  My husband started to work from home like a year ago, it was just a part-time job and not very consistent.It worked well at the beginning but slowly started to be an issue in our relationship. I work full-time and I guess I started to be jealous of his schedule, being able to be home, etc. Since he had so much time, he started to play computer games again (used to play them 24/7 as a teenager) which also included joining some online forums. In July I discovered that he was talking to multiple girls online (sexually and romantically) and that he joined forums such “looking for relationship” etc. He told me he had only talked to one girl (I saw conversations with multiple women) and only because she had mental issues. After that, he stopped talking to them online, yet still kept playing video games. He was supposed to find a new job since his PT job slowly stopped making him any money, yet he wasn’t able to (or didn’t even try) find one within the past 6-7months. He plays his computer games around 10 hours a day, goes to bed at 3-5am pretty much every day, spends money (that I’m trying to save) on his games and ignores everything around the house. Whenever I try to confront him about something he gets very upset, calls me names like “b*tch” “idiot” and just yells at me. Whenever I find out he lied to me about something it’s the same – starts to yell at me, starts to throw things, hit himself, calls me names and sometimes blames it on me. Then he always apologizes and tells me how much he loves me and that I’m his everything. Now he is supposed to go back to school starting in two weeks, but every time I asked him to show me his log in, schedule or just something, he gets upset and his log in magically doesn’t work.I looked at his school email and saw many emails from his school counselors telling him that he was late to sign up and can only sign up for summer semester at this point.

I wasn’t allowed to cry, otherwise she’d punish me more. It was more when I was younger, but I learned not to make these mistakes. I sometimes used to get bruises and stuff. But afterwards, my mother would make it up to me by saying things like “I love you” and “You will always be my cute daughter” and buy me snacks. Otherwise, I enjoyed my mother’s company.

He speaks out of turn, has said mean things, and doesn’t really seem to care about authority or following the rules. (all of this is sometimes) Sometimes, he’s great. He tends to NOT be helpful or kind and is causing himself many issues. He’s had several school detentions for doing things such as name-calling or being disrespectful to his teachers. He is involved in scouting and loves it, but won’t listen to adult leaders or scout leaders. He’s had privileges taken away, and will now need to have his scouting experiences limited as he is not reliable in that setting.

I have a flexible work arrangement and am able to be home most days right after school gets out. I help with homework, we eat meals together–I’ve made a point to tell him in no uncertain terms that my love for him is unconditional. My other kid exhibits none of these behaviors. I’m at a loss.

"My boyfriend and I just moved in together. Since we’ve moved in together, he’s been getting angry with me every day. It usually revolves around me being too quiet. The first time we were in the car and he started yelling at me for being too quiet, I then got even more quiet as I’ve been in an emotionally and physically abusive relationship before (and that used to be the safest reaction) and then he started calling me names. I then had a panic attack, as I suffer from anxiety. Prior to meeting him, I hadn’t had an attack for a year. He always calls me names when he’s angry, and then when he’s calmed down he apologizes and says he’s sorry he’s been a dick, but he loves me, and I just need to give him time to get used to me. I’m starting to think that there’s something wrong with me and it’s my fault that he’s angry at me all the time. I’m walking on egg shells in our home and dread having days off work because he works 4am-11am so is home most of the day. He told me that he was sexually abused when he was younger, and I know that he has a “fuck everyone else” mindset, but he’d never been that way with me. I start shaking every time he yells at me now. If I try to talk to him about it reasonably, he gets even angrier and says I’m trying to blame him for everything when I’m clearly in the wrong. The worst part is that I’m a Detective and have worked in the domestic violence unit before and I should be able to recognize whether or not this is going where I think and feel it might be, but I can’t. I’ve never called him names, and have asked him to try not to do it when he’s mad, but he hasn’t stopped.

"I have been dating a guy for the past 6 months. We met online and both live very busy lives where our careers are very important to us. He currently travels for work to another state Monday-Thursday every week. I am his first serious girlfriend and the only girlfriend he’s introduced to his parents (that don’t even live in the same state as we do). Throughout our 6-month relationship he has taken many steps to show how committed he is to me. For example, when I had received an interview for school in Colorado, he began interviewing for jobs there. For the past couple months, he’s been looking for jobs back in the city that we live in. Despite all the great things he’s done, and despite how much I know he loves me, I have severe trust/jealously issues. My last boyfriend had lied to me and was dating a “friend” while he was dating me. My first love whom I dated for 2.5 years broke up with me because he developed feelings for someone else. Needless to say, I let past experiences and my insecurities get the best of me in my current relationship. I have gotten jealous about his female friends and have admittedly over-reacted many times. However, I have had (what I fear) legitimate reasons to be concerned about his new friendship with a female coworker. Like I said he works out of state during the week. On the phone one night, he mentioned he met a girl at work who’s parents live where his parents live and that she invited him to get together for drinks with her and her brother during Christmas. Fast forward to Christmas, after not responding to my text for hours, he tells me he and his sister were having drinks and playing games at his coworker’s parents house. I got very upset and asked if they had hung out before. He admitted that they spent two hours together ALONE on the beach two days prior. I was distraught and did not speak to him until the next day. He insists they are just friends and I have nothing to worry about. I let it go until I recently saw that they became friends on Facebook. I again got very upset with him and expressed how much it bothered me. He was hurt that I didn’t trust him despite saying time and time again that I had nothing to worry about and that she was just a friend. He isn’t friends with anyone else on Facebook from work other than her and he even works with a guy that went to the same college as him. To me, this situation does not seem right. As I have told him, I fear he has developed feelings for this person and doesn’t want to admit it to himself, let alone me. I don’t want to be with someone who has feelings for someone else and I wish he would just admit it to me if that’s the case.

Growing up, I began to settle with the thought that I was making it up in my head but then around 13/14 I began to remember specifics like how the other person said things like you were born a boy, your just born in the wrong body’ or incidents I woke up in a bed with a naked man. At this time I began questioning if the person I thought I was doing these things with wasn’t even a little girl but an adult man.

"My Sister has Stage 4 Lymphoma and throughout everything I have only been able to help her once. During the time that my vehicle was working I drove her around to help her with errands (depositing money from her benefit), taking her to pay bills, etc. She filled up my tank in exchange, but a month later my car’s transmission failed. She texted me recently and said “You need to step up”, I’m currently without a car, I have no sleeping schedule (it varies as my SO works nights), and I am experiencing signs of Agoraphobia. It is so intense that sometimes I pace between my front and back door trying to feel safe enough to go outside for a Cigarette. I don’t understand how to heal myself let alone be something better for my Sister. And It truly is heartbreaking.

I worked at Humana as a Call center Tech., and I started hearing Voices. I knew they weren’t there, because I’d say “huh?” and my co-workers would tell me they didn’t say anything.

"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years now. After a year of me commuting to see him (he lived 2 hrs away), we purchased a house together in his area and I began working from home. This is when I started to see issues. He would drink heavily every Friday & Saturday which wasn’t different from before but now he was showing his true colors. If he got angry or upset about something, he would take it out on me. He’s threatened to kill himself numerous times and has held loaded guns to his head while screaming at me. He’s even fired off a pistol into the ground right next to me while yelling. Another night, we both were drinking and went to bed late. I woke during the night and ran to the bathroom to vomit. He was angry that he had to come check on me and started to say nasty things. I began yelling at him asking what’s wrong with him and banged my hands onto his chest as I did that. Well, he hauled off and punched me in the fa ce. I never reported this to the police. He’s called me pathetic, said he has no respect for me and many other nasty things. This past May, he put a gun to his head again and that was it for me. I moved back to my town with plans of either selling the home we purchased together or him refinancing to have me removed. He still wouldn’t let me go and I allowed it for some reason!!! We’ve been seeing each other every other weekend since July (again, I’m doing all the driving). He has been doing much better with not drinking but I have caught him lying about it because I can tell when he is. In November, he decided to get drunk again and we had another nasty fight. He apologized saying he would never do it again, that he does not like the person he becomes when he’s drinking and that I should be treated like a queen. So, I gave him yet another chance. This past weekend, I asked if he got beer jokingly and he responded that he did but only a six pack. SMH! He then proceeded to tell me that he wanted to reach out to friends he cut ties with and when I asked if that was a good idea because they like to party, he got enraged!

"My parents have been divorced for 19 years. I grew up with my mother and grandma in her house. During my childhood, my grandma would tell me horrible things about my father such as that he abandoned me, that he doesn’t care about me, etc. which resulted in me not having any kind of relationship with my father up until my late teen years when we started rebuilding it. He and my mother don’t talk and she is convinced that my father wants to turn me against her and this is the reason for many terrible arguments I am having with her which sometimes end in her issuing an ultimatum- either I’ll act the way she wants me to or I can pack my bags and move to my dad’s place. She also claims that I don’t love her or care about her and that I will always prefer my father over her which is not true because for my whole life I wanted them to get along and respect each other. On the other hand, my dad won’t visit me at my place because he could run into my mom since I am living with her. He does hate my mom for all the thing she did to him in the past and is avoiding her completely while she blames him for everything bad that happened to her.

I learned in psychology that one can learn aggressive behaviors from an adult when young. I was wondering if the girl, now about 12 years old, is now showing aggressive behaviors did she learn it from her sibling? Can she be fully conscious that their actions are wrong, knowing she understands right from wrong fully, and be able to change her behavior? Or can one FULLY attribute her behavior to the behavior of the sibling and the way she was conditioned to aggression or does the she hold some accountability of their actions, based off that she understands right from wrong and does behave well in other settings?","I was wondering if the girl, now about 12 years old, is now showing aggressive behaviors did she learn it from her sibling?",Overgeneralization,

Nothing was too alarming until 3 days ago he received some messages, went outside for 1h and when he came back, he started talking to people that weren’t there, yelling, than talking quietly, and it was like he was hallucinating. At one point he even changed his personality. At hospital they said that it was brief reactive psychosis (f23. 9) and gave him clozapine and risperidon, and some other medication that i don’t know. Since then, he did sleep, but he still talks, quietly, but still does.What do you think how long is this going to last? When will he stop talking? And does these hallucinations indicate that he has schizophrenia? I am very worried, so please answer me. Thank you.",,No Distortion,
"I am happily married, working in a job I enjoy, and by all standards live a regular life. But every year, around the same time (the end of January) I become severely depressed. I don’t want to see anyone, I’m not myself at work, I cry all the time, my sleep is affected, and my heart feels likes it’s in overdrive.

"In the last few months, my mom has become convinced that she’s sort of the center of the universe. She often thinks radio stations are made only for her and playing music that speaks only to her. She also has become convinced that someone has hacked her YouTube account and is purposefully playing certain songs to try to tell her something. She often claims to speak to people that have passed away but when you ask her if she means that she’s spoken to a dead person, she says no only that these people are somehow in her head, but she knows they’re actually dead. She has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis for the last ten years or so and I know that researchers have discovered a link between multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia, so I figured it was certainly possible that she has it. She also has been diagnosed with depression and was taking medication to treat it for a time, but she has since quit taking that medication and all of her other medication. She also freaks out everytime there is a sudden noise and she’s convinced that that’s not normal at all and she becomes sort of scared like something is going to happen. She will sometimes make comments about wanting to start seeing her doctor again or seeing a psychiatrist as if she’s aware what she’s doing isn’t normal. I’m not sure what to do or how to help her or if I’m even on the right track. Thank you in advance.",,No Distortion,
"I have been trying to figure out what’s the matter with me for the last 3 years. I was first diagnosed with depression and tried a bunch of SSRIs that had no good or bad effect on me. I then did a sleep study and was diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia. I was put on modafinil and it helped a little bit but eventually wore off and now I’m on armodafinil which has even less of an effect than modafinil did. The doc also prescribed Lexapro (which i’ve been on before) with the armodafinil and this time around it made me feel kind of depressed. The doctor took me off of it (this is a sleep doctor by the way) and explained that since I had a bad reaction to the Lexapro that i may have Bi-polar Depression. I don’t fit the signs of this but upon trying to relate to this condition I stumbled upon ADHD symptoms, how it is confused with depression, and how it can go undetected. The symptoms of ADHD fit me like a glove. I am forgetful, I lose things to an extreme that it disrupts my life. I have had anxiety since I was a child, I’m restless, impulsive, impatient, I have very bad fidgeting and nail-biting habits, I zone out on conversations, I have had drug and alcohol addictions in the past, I drink coffee all day and all night long, and my husband is put through hell trying to keep up with and clean up my messes, I even have to keep my cards and ID in his wallet so that I don’t lose them. I also am very unorganized and messy and I stress myself out and beat myself up for it on a daily basis to the point that I exert more energy fighting with myself to fold the laundry than it would take to fold the laundry.

"My first cousin has a problem. When she was a child, she heard an aunt say “i can not imagine something moving inside of me” and the other one was when the comedian Chelsea Handler said “I don’t think I would ever be able to carry the baby to full term, I would feel so “trapped”. She repeats these 2 thoughts.Last year she was pregnant and miscarried because of the abnormalities and before she was referred to an abortion, the doctors told her “You can not get an abortion until the committee approves the diagnosis” and she freaked out. She could not imagine being trapped with something inside of her without having the control to expel it or keep it or to do what she wanted. This thought was traumatic for her. She was pregnant 3 times. The first time she felt good/proud but her husband wanted an abortion.Later on they decided to have children but she had 2 miscarriages. First was early in pregnancy and the second one was at 4m. She was ok with it at 3,5m but then they told her something was wrong with the fetus and for her, even thought she later on cried and felt deep sorrow, she still felt relieved. Now that she is supposed to be doing ivf, she is afraid “what if she changes her mind in the middle of the pregnancy?” or “how will she react when she feels first baby kicks, will she freak out?”. Tried talking to a therapist but without success. She can not talk to her husband or anyone else bc all this is strange. She generally has low self-esteem. Her mother was not a warm person and never developed a relationship with her. She is 40 so she does have to do it soon. Ironically, she does want to have a child (her own) and says that she will be a great mother once the baby is “out”. She is a very nice, warm and rational person. She is preparing for the pregnancy now and freaking out. Not connecting to the idea of being pregnant in a way other women do. Generally doubtful of people (had a hard life, turbulent upbringing etc). Asked me recently “what if I decide to terminate the pregnancy at 25 weeks, where can i go, where can i do it?”Together we searched the net, thinking maybe if I give her answers and security “you can control what to do with your body” that this would calm her down and actually make her want the baby, and it did but only until week 22 or so.

"I hope I’m just a perfectionist, but sometimes I feel like my behavior is too bizarre. I like order, routine, and organization, but I am not sure if I’m going too far with this. If fail anything I gave effort to I will not except it. I will beat myself up over it until I get it. One very unhealthy example of this would be my eating behavior. I want the perfect body and I don’t care how much mental exhaustion I have to deal with to get it. I fast for days and I refuse to eat foods that I deem as “bad”. If I do end up breaking this, which happens during breaks or family reunion dinners, I make up by extreme dieting next few days. Another example would be in school. I will study until I can no longer see words clearly on the paper or the screen, which some people might think is a good habit, so I am not exactly sure about this particular case.

I read about it somewhere that it takes 30 seconds for germs to actually come off, so again I’m not sure if not is actually abnormal.

"I was diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety as a teenager, dealing with cutting and bulimia. As the years have gone by, I’ve been on and off of medications and while I knew I still dealt with the mental illness, I felt like I’d grown a lot. Over the last couple of years, though, things have gotten bad again. It seems that I’ll be fine or at least stable for months until something will go wrong, and it’s like a house of cards toppling over. It’ll send me spiraling into what I refer to as an episode for lack of a better word. I’ve described episodes before to my previous nurse practitioner/psychologists, but it never occurred to me until recently that I should’ve told them about the voice I would hear during the episodes. I’ve always just thought of it as my own thoughts, except way louder and more aggressive, but after reading about the difference between your own voice in your head and hearing a voice, I’m now more concerned about the episodes. The last time I had one, I ended up grabbing a bottle of pills, stealing a knife from my sister’s house, sending my mom a goodbye text, and walking the streets in 20 degree weather while cutting myself and all at the urging of what I thought to be my own thoughts. However, looking back on it, I can still hear the voice berating me, referring to me in the third person instead of first. My thinking is completely distorted during these episodes, and as soon as I come out of it (usually within a few hours), I’m embarrassed by my actions and think clearly again. For example, one time I was so anxious that no one would pick me to do a group project with them in class, that I went home and started cutting so my mom would have to take me to the hospital and I’d get to miss school the day they chose partners. Is that delusional thinking? I’ve never met someone with depression/anxiety who has episodes that intense and rapid. It’s like feeling the craziness of mania, but without the happiness/confidence. Is there a such thing as having depression with psychotic episodes or is that normal and I’m just thinking too deep into it or being a hypochondriac?","I’ve always just thought of it as my own thoughts, except way louder and more aggressive, but after reading about the difference between your own voice in your head and hearing a voice, I’m now more concerned about the episodes.",Overgeneralization,

"I feel I’ll never be in a relationship. I’m 23 and never have. There’s nothing wrong with me from the outside looking, in fact, I always have admirers and guys who ask me out. I’m funny, nice and quite good looking. However, I have a super hard time developing feelings for guys, and the few ones I really fall for never ever like me back, which makes me feel like a failure. I’ve been on many dates with great guys who were serious and were looking for a relationship, and in the beginning when a handsome guy gives me attention I feel thrilled about it and even fantasize about us getting together, but as soon as he actually tells me he likes me or starts showing physical affection, the world turns upside down, and no matter how attracted I was to him, I start feeling sick, and feel like I’m in a parallel universe because a good guy liking me is not supposed to happen in real life, just in my fantasies. It’s like a thousand voices in my head start screaming at me how I don’t deserve it and how life is playing me an evil trick and if I fall for it, something horribly painful will happen and I will make a fool out of myself. I don’t even know how to word or interpret these feelings, but they take over me completely and I get confused, sad and repellant towards the guy. It always ends up with me running away, not looking back. I’m always the one to break things up, no guy has ever really rejected me, and yet being rejected scares me so much my subconscious seems to drive me to “leave before I get left” as Taylor Swift puts it… So basically, when it’s clear that a guy likes me back, I lose my feelings for him and get super uncomfortable instead.

"About 5 years ago, I started seeing a therapist weekly to do CBT for my lifelong anxiety. However, my anxiety quickly latched onto the therapy itself. I found myself worrying constantly about what the therapist thought of me and whether I was doing therapy wrong. Going to sessions became a major anxiety-inducing experience, and everything the therapist said felt like criticism. I eventually worked up the courage to talk to the therapist about the issue. She said she understood. We discussed it several times and challenged some of my beliefs about it. But it didn’t help. So, a year later, I discontinued regular therapy. I learned a few useful strategies for anxiety but also came away feeling worse about myself. Last year, after experiencing some stressors in my life – which caused extreme anxiety – I went to see a new therapist. I thought this time would be different. I told the therapist right at the start about my therapy anxiety. Yet now, a year later, I find myself in the same pattern. I feel that my anxiety about the therapeutic process itself, and my relationship with the therapist, is getting in the way of therapy. The therapist is well aware of the issue and we discuss it frequently. She suggests things for me to do – ways to ground myself during sessions, exposure-based approaches to accept the uncertainty – but I’m unable to do them, which makes me feel even more anxious and frustrated. Sessions have now turned into a huge performance anxiety thing for me because I’m so afraid of how they’ll go. My therapist doesn’t *feel* like an ally to me (but I know it’s not her, it’s me). I’m at a loss. Again, I feel worse about myself now than when I started therapy. I do okay in my life despite my anxiety – I have a full time job and a good long-term relationship. I would still like to find ways to reduce the amount of worrying I do … but I can’t seem to be able to overcome my anxiety about therapy to make therapy useful to me.

I am very worried for her because her anger and attacking of us and others is escalating to the point that she is unreasonable and cannot be reached and is shutting all of us out. things are so blown out of proportion and she is completely unreasonable and so angry that she is saying hateful and horrible things mostly through texts saying she is done with all of us.. she goes on and on relentlessly attacking us and anyone who disagrees with her.. she has a victim mentality where everyone else is alienating her, not caring for her, abusing her, etc. I am beyond heartbroken. this description is oversimplified in light of trying to give the picture and be brief.","we have had issues in the past, but this is intensified as I believe she is reflecting on her life–I believe she is reviewing and trying to figure out how she ended up in the situation she is in and she wants to blame everyone else.",Mind Reading,
"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years and have been living together for a little over 3 years. About a year ago his friend stayed over at our house while we were out on vacation, I’ve never met his friend before and only said yes because he said his friend was trustworthy. His friend ended up bringing over a female coworker and not letting us know but I found an eyeliner so I was upset and asked my boyfriend to talk to him since he didn’t want me to talk to his friend myself. Fast forward to last night his friend (the same one) called me my boyfriends ex-girlfriends name. Keep in mind this guy has been at my house and my boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. I got upset and ended up leaving early because I was so mad and didn’t want to make a scene with someone I barely knew. Before I left I told my boyfriend he needed to talk to him because his friend disrespected me and made me wonder why he would call me someone’s name who was in my boyfriend’s life over 4 years ago. He said he talked to him and told him to apologize to me so his friend tried to add me on Instagram to apologize. I want nothing to do with his friend and I’m upset that all my boyfriend did was have a talk with his friend that I made him have and then went on to act like nothing happened. Now we’re arguing because I’m afraid my boyfriend doesn’t respect me since he did absolutely nothing except what I asked him to do. I feel like I shouldn’t have to deal with after being with him for 4 years, we also just bought a house together 3 months ago. Am I wrong to want him to do more than just talk to his friend (a talk I asked him to do) ?

"I am in a situation where I have been the patient understanding partner but am at a point where I am considering leaving the relationship because of the kid. I think first is the issue of discipline. My partner, to me, is very inconsistent in his discipline being simultaneously too harsh and lenient (ex. “I’m going to get my belt if you don’t listen and I am not giving you anything to eat, now come here and give me a hug. Want to watch TV?”). I do not directly address this in disagreement but he can tell from my facial expression that I am not with this. So he gets extremely defensive. All I can say is that I am allowed to have thoughts and those thoughts can disagree. But he wants me to agree with him and I just do not. There is also a jealousy issue. I bought his kid a stuffed animal and my partner says “it’s a good thing that I didn’t buy a stuffed animal like I was going to cause then we would have to see whose gift he likes more”. On Christmas day, when kid opened up a guitar he received from his dad and couldn’t put it down, his dad yells “He likes my gift the best. I win!”. The incidents that I mentioned above were minor but there have been really big arguments that have ensued from either in which my partner’s go to excuse for yelling and screaming is that he is the parent and I need to stay in my lane. Just to clarify, once me going out of my lane involved me getting a lint roller to remove cat hair from his son’s pjs before he put it on. I had matching pjs and the plan was that me and his kid were going to wear the pjs and have a movie and popcorn night. His dad said that he couldn’t wear the pjs because he needed to get the cat hair off first. He was in the middle of cooking so I went to do it. I was yelled at for trying to undermine his authority because he already said that his son was not to wear those pjs at all (that was not what he said). I honestly feel it was a ploy to ruin pajama night. I am noticing that part of the problem is that my partner doesn’t want certain things getting back to the baby mama for fear she will use their kid as leverage and not allow him to see his son. After over a year of dating, I am beginning to just feel resentful and emotionally alienated but feel like I am not allowed to have those feelings because I am not the one with the kid and that kids are supposed to come first.","After over a year of dating, I am beginning to just feel resentful and emotionally alienated but feel like I am not allowed to have those feelings because I am not the one with the kid and that kids are supposed to come first.",Emotional Reasoning,Should statements

Does a person have utter and complete freedom to change his reality or would there always be a faction of his brain leading him to a biased conclusion because of his past experience. For example can a person fully understand and change his reality without his brain affecting that decision based on his past. In other words , a person who grew up in a religion , and changes his religion, can he or she be able to fully accept a new belief and formulate a new truth based ok current thinking and not be influenced by the past.

"Does it ever happen that panic attacks (and by extension, panic disorder) develop from another condition? I started having panic attacks about eight months ago with varying frequency and intensity. I’ve never had some of the most common complaints, like feelings of choking or having a heart attack. Mostly I get very dizzy and spacey, along with a panicked feeling of course. It’s sometimes hard to follow conversations or even keep my balance. I’ve also started having blurry vision (akin to nearsightedness) and sometimes cloudy vision. More recently I’ve been getting shaky too. It used to be a slight tremble at most, but now I occasionally have people ask me if I’m alright or comment that it’s not that cold out because I look like I’m shivering. This doesn’t necessarily happen during a panic attack either. Sometimes I’ll be laying in bed trying sleep or driving to work when it happens. I know these things can be symptoms of panic and are common side effects of medications, but they don’t seem to correlate with changes in dosage or starting/stopping a med. In addition, I’m just wondering (maybe even hoping) if it’s not uncommon for people to have panic attacks as a result of other underlying issues. I’m going back to get blood tests done soon (my gp has been on me about it for months, but it’s hard to find a day that I’m both off work and also feeling up to it). Last time I had them done everything was more or less normal, but that was over a year before all this started. I keep telling myself that there must be something else causing me to feel this way, because like I said, I don’t seem to experience panic attacks quite the same as most people. It’s also concerning that my prescribed benzodiazepine stops the panic, but a lot of the other symptoms persist (like the blurry vision, dizziness, and extreme fatigue despite it being the smallest dose). Is this something that happens with any kind of frequency? In truth, I’m sort of hoping there’s something else going on that is a little more… definitive, if that makes sense. Thanks.","I keep telling myself that there must be something else causing me to feel this way, because like I said, I don’t seem to experience panic attacks quite the same as most people.",Magnification,

I wear lingerie & panties… can’t accept and can’t stop… (HELP) I’m a 28 year old married male with a new 8 month old son. Ever since I can remember (around 8 years old) I’ve had a thing for women’s undergarments. I can remember looking at the old JC Penney’s catalogue and immediately being drawn to the lingerie pages wondering how it might feel to wear these items. I took this wonderment to the actual by trying on my mom’s panties and occasionally my sister’s. I couldn’t help then and now to feel how taboo this is and that I am wrong in doing it… still to this day it feels wrong… I cannot accept this part of my life.

"My husband I have been married for three years and up until about three months ago, things have been great. There have been a number of stressful events for him lately: I had a minor health crisis and a car accident (unrelated), he experienced medication-induced weight gain (a BIG no-no for him). Also, he was adopted as a baby and recently found his biological family. That’s been very positive, but very emotional too. Lately, he’s been lashing out at me on a regular — almost nightly basis. The slightest thing can set him off. He gets angry if I don’t help enough. But many times, I’ll ask “What can I do for you after work?” He’ll say “nothing.” Then he gets mad at me for not helping. Or he’ll say he had ABCDXYZ to do and I didn’t do any of it. If I point out that I had no idea he had all that and he should have asked for my help, he snaps that I should have just known it. I try to stay calm but it’s hard not to feel hurt when he hurls accusations at me, like saying I don’t care about him and that I just married him for his money. That’s not true. He’s also angry that I’m close to my family (he’s never gotten along with his adoptive parents) and he keeps insisting that I must have been molested as a child and then brainwashed because that’s the only reason I’d be so loyal to them. I’m hoping finding and bonding with his biological family — which is already happening — will help with the family stuff but I’m still afraid. I love my family. I know they’re not perfect but I also know they’d NEVER hurt me. Or him.

"My problem started when i started seriously training in ballet. I loved ballet and considered it my life. Around the age of 12 my mother made it seem to me that ballet was the only thing i could do in my life and i had no other option but to do it. Ballet made me hate myself, i constantly felt like i was not good enough and even my teachers would tell me i wasnt good enough. So i quit ballet and everything went downhill from there. I made a bad decision just like im sure every teenager has done once in their life. I went to hang out with friends during the day without telling my parents when i moved 1000 ft away. instead of being grounded for a week or two i was told all of these horrible things such as your a failure, your a disappointment, your a whore, your a slut, no one likes you, your trash, you have no real friends, kill yourself. Ever since then (that was around 6 months ago) ive been told that every day. My whole life has been one bad event after an other and nothing ever seems to get better. I have no one to talk to about how i feel and dont know how to fix this. I feel like nothing will ever be better for me and im starting to believe that i am what my mom tells me.

But i also am angry all the time towards my mother. she grosses me out but i cant control it. when im around her my ‘habits’ act up. but theyre more like natural reactions than habits. I dont know if medication will help with these problems or if i need sleep or if its stress. I really need some advice because i hate living like this. Am I going crazy? (life at home) My mom some times goes a little crazy or acts stranger than usual. she yells at me than apologizes. it gives me whipelash. i know she sees a therapist and i just hope that craziness isnt heretitary. can living with someone make you sick of them? even if their your own mother? and my father is an alcholic. but he has been 7 months sober. i am the middle child and i get along fine with my siblings. although my brother often gets annoyed with me because of my breathing habits. they annoy him. I also have severe headaches. Sometimes they give me excrutiating pains and sometimes they are dull. I also feel depressed and sad all the time. I try to act happy when im around my friends but i want to feel truely happy. Im usually in my room all day after school breathing in and out in certain ways, trying to reset the “bad germs” that i have breathed in. (im sorry if ive confused you). I had a concussion in the past but im not sure if ive fully healed, or its all in my head. i get weird head aches in the front of my mind when im doing my rituals and it throws off my day. sometimes i dont feel like im in my body/mind. i feel like im always tired and i feel like im always asleep. and i dont feel my emotions to the fullest. sometimes i dont feel any emotions. its hard to explain. but i just need some advice. Im handeling this all on my own and Im not sure WHAT to do. i keep a journal of everything that goes on and it makes me more depressed. im not sure if you know what im asking or not. but please help me if you can!",I’m too young to be worrying about my life the way I do.

It automatically put me in a more dominant position. I warned him I don’t feel the same like he feels for me but that we have fun together, we click and I enjoy spending time with him.

I pretend that my favorite characters from movies and TV shows are real, and I talk to myself, both as myself and the character. I have long discussions with myself. I also pretend that they are with me everywhere I go–to the supermarket, to my cousin’s house. I pretend that they’re with me, no matter what I do. Lately, I’ve also been doing something that’s hard to explain: I pretend to be two people (usually myself and my mother, or a cousin, or a made-up person) and have a pretend to have a conversation with them. I pretend that the fiction character is watching me and my mother/cousin/other. Usually, those scenarios involve either a verbal fight, or joking.

Quick note: I used to have depression and was sent to a therapist to recover. I mentioned that I had been in her place and knew how she felt. She wouldn’t listen and threatened not being our friend if we didn’t cancel that session. I’m guessing that was because it was in the school and she didn’t want her bullies finding out.

"I am a senior in college and during the second semester of my freshman year, I met a guy in my chemistry lab. Initially, I hated him because he seemed to act somewhat pompous. But at the beginning of my sophomore year, we began to develop a relationship. Initially, we were just friends and I never really felt any kind of intimate feelings for him. As with any other attractive guy I’ve met, however, I was somewhat shy around him at first but started to feel more comfortable as I got to know him better. But still, we were strictly friends. It wasn’t until the summer between my sophomore and junior year that I realized that I had feelings for him. We spent a lot of time together, as we were both taking the same summer school class. During this summer, I found out a lot about him. I noticed that he didn’t speak about his dad a lot, if at all, and he liked to garden, cook, and was very meticulous about how he looked. I attributed these qualities to the possibility that he was a very proper gentleman, as he surprisingly turned out to be due to the fact that I used to hate him. One of my good female friends met him and immediately told me that he was gay. I disagreed with her. I had remembered him telling me about a girl he dated back in high school, so I assumed him to be straight. But then he had also mentioned that the reason why they broke up was because he told her that they got along better as friends. I’ve heard this excuse from other guys, so it didn’t hint to me that he was gay. During my junior year, he told my aforementioned female friend that he was gay, and she relayed the information to me. My first reaction was denial. I think that I had so severly developed feelings for him, almost on an unconscious level, that I couldn’t bear to believe that he was gay. Later that week though, he told me face-to-face. After that, our friendship didn’t fall apart and I wasn’t distressed. In fact, our friendship strengthened and for a while things were great. I have told him several times that I have feelings for him, and he just laughs it off. I’m not sure if he realizes that I’m serious.","I think that I had so severly developed feelings for him, almost on an unconscious level, that I couldn’t bear to believe that he was gay.",Magnification,

"So, in early October of 2017 I was suffering from intrusive/homicidal thoughts. Basically, I wanted to shoot up my school. I told an ex-friend about it and now I regret it. I’m so afraid she’s going to tell my school or someone in general and the fear is ruining my life. To clarify, I do not have these thoughts or urges anymore. At the time I was extremely obsessed with school shootings (for example: columbine). I think it is what encouraged me to think these things but what also encouraged me is the fact that I hated myself. I’ve always been insecure. I have never been good enough and it caused me to want to take out my anger on others. My home life is good and I do not get bullied which makes me feel worse about having these thoughts. I feel selfish and stupid. A girl on Instagram even messaged me at one point, asking me if I wanted to participate in carrying out a school shooting and I said yes (I never went through with it and I told her no later on). I just felt like I had nothing to lose. I had anger towards myself which led me to have anger towards others. I regret ever having these thoughts and this haunts me every day. I feel like I’m carrying around this huge secret and it’s ruining me. I feel like if everyone knew they would resent me. This whole situation has also caused me to self-harm again after being clean for a while. I hate myself for ever wanting to hurt anyone. The pain I’ve felt from this is unbearable. I’ve thought about suicide but I’m determined to feel better. I want to forgive myself, forget, and move on. Your advice would be much appreciated. Thank you.",I feel selfish and stupid.,Labeling,

I’m 63-year-old male. I was abused physically and emotionally from a very young age by my father. He often whipped me with a thin pigskin belt as hard as he could while he screamed at me. When I cried he would whip me until I stopped crying. I remember the feeling of imploding when I had to do this. My mother tried to make him stop but he would lock us in the bathroom while the beating took place. I can still hear my mother screaming from the other side of the door for him to stop. When he didn’t whip me he called me names and told me I would never amount to anything.

For a while, at the thought of my therapist, I thought she was narcissistic. However, I was looking into sensory integration disorder for myself on the internet and stumbled upon the term thought disorders in a forum where a woman thought her son had SI and mentioned he didn’t speak right. When I looked it up on Wikipedia it mentioned symptoms like blocking, circumferential speech, derailment, distractible speech, loss of goal, and semantic paraphasia. All of which I’ve known her to do. She’s mostly coherent but often does at least one every time I see her. Usually several. For example, if it’s just the two of us she’ll go on and on rambling about nothing in particular while often switching topics. Then she’ll experience blocking and ask what she was just talking about. Or she’ll substitute words in sentences with random words. She does this last one a lot. For example, she’ll say, “I slipped on the water outside on the patio.” And I’ll correct her, “No, it was inside in the kitchen.” She’ll respond, “That’s what I said”. And I’ll say, “no it wasn’t.” She just say “oh” and shrug her shoulders. I don’t think she’s ever called me by my own name.

"I am 16, and from the age of 13 and younger ive shown no signs of having any anti-social behavioural disorders. Lately, however, i have recognised how little i truely care for others or how little remorse i feel in any situation. I must comment that i do feel as if i have a certain love towards dogs and often at times feel anxious and shy in social encounters. This, however is mostly due to the fact that i am uncomfortable being around people and social encounters are often followed by explosive bursts of rage. My speculations have mainly arrived through the fact that i have noticed that i am distinctly socially different from everyone else, and often feel nothing when others around me are crying, laughing or chatting. I also have a strong urge to be in a position of power, always aiming to be in controll of people and their actions and to be ontop of social encounters, remaining one step ahead. This is often made difficult, however due to my inverted personality. I myself find it strange that i feel so jelous and so eager to be in control when i care so little about these people or the things they say and do. Although i have grew up in a loving, stable family, often find myself laughing at jokes and enjoying tv shows, and feel as if i could never hurt an animal (although i have no problem with hurting humans), is it possible that i have an anti-social behavioral disorder such as sociopathy?

"In the recent months, my mother and my father had a fight. Which ended in my father wanting to leave, but he didn’t because my mom begged him to stay. She told us that, and we (her children ) supposedly don’t know they fought. But as the months have gone by she has completely crumbled. She has many breakdowns on weekends when my father goes out. When she has these breakdowns, she talks in a really suicidal way. She tells us how she wants to die, how she feels guilty, how she wants things to go back, how she really just wants to disappear. She acts this way because since they fought, my father completely neglected my mom. He told her that she can’t love her anymore and that he can’t forgive her. So coming back to her breakdowns, it is really worrying to see her in that state, in which she cries for hours and hours until she calms down. As her children, who are young we can’t really do anything for her other than give her a shoulder. But it has gotten to a point where she cries whenever she is alone. We don’t know what to do anymore, because she has stopped eating or resting. My father’s harsh words towards her really don’t help her, because she still hopes he might love her one day. So we just are desperate, because we feel that hugging her is not enough to help her be happy again. So, I ask for advice because my mother’s condition really just gets worse as days go by.

I’ll say that she has never exhibited behavior like this in all the time we’ve been together.

He fighted with weed dependence, he had obsessive compulsive thoughts because of drugs, anxiety…then a doctor recommended him Seroxat, he had a dependence for this medication too.

"One month ago my 14 year old daughter texted me from school saying that my husband (her stepdad) had asked her to change her shirt in front of him while I wasn’t home, and that he had also came into the bathroom while she was in the shower and ruffled the curtain and said “let me see”. I was devastated because I never ever thought something like this could happen. He has moved out now, and has promised to go to counseling. My question is if families are able to come back from something like this or not, and also, if he gets help and apologized to her and I make sure all precautions are in place so this never happens again, if it’s horrible for me to expect her to be ok with letting him move back in. We have two sons together and I want our family to stay intact. He is an incredible person and provider. He has been very depressed since the passing of his father. He admitted to it and cried for a whole week because he feels so horrible for what he has done. I know on he inside he is a good person. I’m just blown away that this happened. I want to protect my daughter above all else. I’ve told him if he moves back in and anything like this happened again I would report it and he would lose his kids. He swears it was just a glitch and he was just depressed and he is very, very sorry for it and he would never do it again. He did not ever touch her, and when he asked that of her she said no, so he didn’t see her at all. It was mostly just words but I know words can be the most hurtful.

"I would not consider this an “issue.” However I am curious to understand the potential reasoning’s behind this. Usually I spend a great majority of my free time in solitude, I don’t bother having social interactions with others (family or acquaintances) because quite frankly it is not enjoyable or particularly interesting. As far as intimacy goes I absolutely disdain love and affection. My childhood was great, and I do not have any family issues currently or from the past. I simply find that love and affection disgusts me. I realized that when I was 12, my mother would shower me with love and it would completely irritate me and grind my gears. She knows now that I do not like that so she stopped. The issue however, is my lack of any emotion and care for others. I am an introvert, but most introverts have some kind of social interactions with close friends or acquaintances. I however don’t have friends since most people cant meet my expectations and when I am friendly to someone they associate that with interest and they start to become annoying and wanting to have a conversation. I usually show them I am uninterested by replying with single words or expressing no emotion on my face until its awkward and they say goodbye. I cant connect with people at all on an emotional level is what I realized I don’t care about the persons dreams, desires, emotions or well-being for that matter. This may come across as very blunt and rude. But I don’t even care about my parents in the same manor I don’t care about other people. I don’t mind socializing so long as there is a clear goal (work or educational space). I don’t enjoy communicating with people for enjoyment. My lack of intimacy is probably a direct result of my disinterest with socializing with people. That being said feedback on this would be much appreciated.",My lack of intimacy is probably a direct result of my disinterest with socializing with people.,Overgeneralization,

"So my younger brother who is in his twenties just pulled out two knives on my mom in the kitchen because they got into a verbal fight. My mom is very over protective and cares about her kids very much and can sometimes be overbearing. My mom got into a verbal argument with him because she didn’t like who he was hanging out with and his current job. My brother goes from job to job and can never maintain one stable job. He is constantly asking my parents for money and they always give it to him because they feel bad for him. He asked my mom for gas money and he ended up using it for something else that she doesn’t approve of. Long story short, he went on his normal psycho outbursts that he always does but this time he pulled out the knife which he never has done before. I’m also concerned because whenever my brother is really pissed off he’ll say things like I’m going to go shoot some people I’m going to kill people he says this during his crazy psychotic outbursts, but then 10-15 minutes later when he’s calmed down he apologizes and says he doesn’t mean it. I have several videos I’ve recorded of him saying this, without him knowing. I recorded this because I NEVER ever want him to legally purchase a gun. If I ever found out he wanted to buy one, I want to use these videos to the police so they can put on his record that he cannot buy one. I know my brother very well, and a lot of times he can be really nice but when he says he is going to kill people it really frightens me, especially with all the active shooting going on.

"A few months ago, I started seeing a counselor for the first time at my college. The reality is, I should have seen a counselor a very long time ago but I was always reluctant too until a recent breakdown. My entire life, I’ve always felt very anxious around almost any social situation. I have always been extremely shy and struggle making friends. I assume people are thinking negative of me and won’t like me, therefore I may come off really distant and very difficult to get to know. I struggle trusting anyone, making it really hard for me to make friendships (or keep friendships of any kind). It causes me a lot of issues in my job and my professional performance because I lack self-confidence and fear being judged. The counselor seemed to agree that what I was explaining seemed a lot like social anxiety. Even going to see a counselor was extremely challenging even after multiple sessions, I was still feeling as anxious/shy since the first few sessions. It’s really hard for me to warm up to people (if not seemingly impossible even if I know them for years) even though the counselor was very kind and nice. I found therapy hard and became frustrated with myself, so I called it quits after like the 8th or 9th session. I did make some progress and learned a lot, so it wasn’t a total waste of time. But overall, I felt hopeless like things for me weren’t ever going to change. I’m able to “Challenge” my negative thoughts with more positive ones but it didn’t really change how I truly felt. So, I began doing some research online about SAD and came across the term “avoidant personality disorder”…the description seemed very similar to SAD and began to wonder what if I had APD? Then, I also learned that treating personality disorders can be very difficult and may not be curable but treatment may relieve some symptoms. It kind of made me feel hopeless because what if the reason I haven’t been able to be “free” from this is because I have APD? Or am I overreacting? I’m not a huge fan of labels but wondering if it’s common for a therapist to tell you if they diagnosed you or not? Mine didn’t really ever “diagnose” me, they did however tell me the therapy we did was CBT.","I assume people are thinking negative of me and won’t like me, therefore I may come off really distant and very difficult to get to know.

"My husband left almost 3 years ago and lives with his affair partner. Before he left, he exhibited signs of depression, mood swings, and his behavior became erratic. He’s now living a completely new life in another state but yet has not filed for divorce. For the first two years, he would communicate sometimes but would not respond to legal issues. I kept busy living my life and didn’t contact him unless it was about legal matters, but I was always kind and treated him with respect. Last year I was diagnosed with advanced stage cancer and have not heard from him since. He’s even changed his contact information. I’m really struggling with understanding how I was a huge part of his life for almost two decades and even though we are still married, his actions show that he truly does not care about me. I can understand “falling out of love,” but how does someone just stop caring? My self-esteem has plummeted and it’s excruciating to feel like someone I knew for so long and shared so much of my life with doesn’t care if I live or die. I have worked hard to understand that his actions are not my fault, but I am having such a hard time accepting how he could learn that I have cancer and intentionally make my life more difficult by disappearing without getting divorced, and how he could just erase me from his life as if I never existed. I don’t want what’s left of my life to be spent dealing with this painful issue and I try not to think about him too much but I feel like our unfinished marriage is hanging over my head.","I’m really struggling with understanding how I was a huge part of his life for almost two decades and even though we are still married, his actions show that he truly does not care about me.",Mind Reading,
"Hello, my name is —- and I have a question regarding my partner’s mental health. I’ve been worried about my boyfriend for the past few weeks, as he very recently seems to be displaying psychotic issues. I’ve been dating him for about 4 mos, and he, in the past few weeks, has been acting oddly. For background, we are both 20 years old. In the past year, he was kicked out of his mothers house for being transgender, and has spent some time being homeless. He recently got into an apartment, and registered an emotional support animal. He also says he is very happy in his relationship with me. So things seem to be looking up in his life, yet his mental state gets worse and worse. A few months ago he told me that schizophrenia runs in his family, but the symptoms he described his relatives as having didn’t line up with schizophrenia at all (no paranoia, hallucinations, disorganized thoughts/speech). I told him that maybe they were misdiagnosed, and that seemed to ease his mind a bit.","So things seem to be looking up in his life, yet his mental state gets worse and worse.

The reason my parents won’t let me play it is because of the mature content but I’m not interested in the sex and drugs and the violence is unrealistic enough not to affect me at all.

I respond by asking her why she’s talking to me the way that she is, she responds with Ugh I don’t care just be quiet, if you’re not going to help me then leave. I don’t think that she understands how the way she talks to people effects their ability to help her in stressful situations. She doesn’t realize that I’m trying to help her, and that she is actually making it difficult. She also does not learn from her experiences. She has been yelled at, been talked calmly to, and has even been hit on multiple occasions. I don’t think that she realizes that what she does is wrong, because she does the exact same things that she is punished/scrutinized for over and over again. It’s an endless cycle.

When the family member is questioned about rather something actually happened or not, they deny the scenario ever occurring.

He also hears hallucinations from time to time but ignores them. He is currently on probation for a crime I believe he didn’t commit (but I’m not the law). The scenario happened at his mother’s apartment. However, when I first questioned him about it before he started his court appointed therapy, he told me it happened at his friend’s house.

He was emotionally aggressive and cruel towards me and I felt abused very often.

" My husband and I are both nurses. We have two sons. Our oldest will turn five in May and our second son will turn one in April. My husband works full time while I stay home with the kids. Tonight, I caught our 4-year-old wearing my thong underwear under his pajamas. It turns out, he stashed some of my underwear in his room along with two of my Victoria’s Secret catalogs. We talked to him about this. I have always noticed evidence of what Freud calls the oedipal complex in my son. He is a smart boy and has adapted quite well to his new role as big brother. He has said “why did God not make me into a girl” but when I explore this, it turns out that what he really means is that he likes girls, including mommy because girls are pretty. I have never seen any other “feminine” tendencies in him (he’ll say pink is for girls and refuse to ride a Barbie bike) but I just want to make sure that this is just a normal phase for him and we shouldn’t be thinking about gender issues here.

"I’m currently in a very happy and otherwise healthy, long-term romantic relationship for the first time in my life. My boyfriend is a very caring and sensitive guy and we both love each other very much, but I’m concerned that some of my pre-existing sexual issues may cause problems down the road for our relationship. I have primary vaginismus and vulvodynia, and my first sexual experiences were very negative and traumatic. I have been to a gynecologist about these issues and went through physical therapy to try and overcome them, but even after a few years penetration is still painful and sometimes very difficult. While trusting my partner makes a big difference in reducing the amount of pain I’m in during sex, and with my current boyfriend there have been several occasions where it was virtually painless, it’s still a constant factor in my sex-life. While I do enjoy the intimacy of sex with my boyfriend despite this, I have never been able to achieve orgasm no matter what my partner tries to do or for how long. Even with assistance from vibrators it’s virtually impossible, and the only way I’ve managed to achieve orgasm is by my own intervention. I don’t understand why I have this issue, especially because I am very attracted to him.

I am just trying to figure out if my childhood sexplay with a younger same sex cousin was normal or abuse. It all started with her wanting to comb my hair. She had to be 6 or 7 and I about 8 or 9. It went from combing my hair to rubbing my shoulders to us kissing. Eventually it lead to us touching. She would come over every now and then and we would experiment. I think eventually it led to oral by her suggestion because she would engage in the same activity with her mother’s daughter’s friend. I stopped once I got caught dry humping another girl who was around my age. My mom didn’t scold me but had a sit down with myself and the other girl along with the other mom to say it was inappropriate. My cousin would still come over to spend the night and rub against my leg to make me join in sexual play but I would say no firmly and kick her hand or foot off me. I guess my guilt stems from me being older. I should have known better. And I feel absolutely terrible about it. It keeps me up all night sometimes. I don’t remember her trying to force me other than the rubbing leg incident. And I don’t remember me forcing her to do anything. When I think about it I think she was far more advanced mentally than I was. My aunts house did not have the same rules as mine. The kids watched whatever they wanted even R-rated movies as they always had televisions in their room. When I would go over their house they would always call me “slow” because I didn’t get certain things. I guess being that I wasn’t street smart like them and was sheltered (no tv in the rooms only age appropriate shows). Anyway these sexual play encounters have really plagued my with tremendous guilt recently. I don’t want to think that I molested my younger cousin. I turned very mean to her to nip all attempts of sexual play in the bud. To make her hate me was a mechanism to keep us safe and appropriate I guess. She eventually came out as bisexual. I don’t want to think that I did this to her.. Please please help me figure this one out.

"I have been in a relationship with a man in his mid-40’s for over a year, and as a couple without outside influences we have a supportive, loving and kind relationship, and rarely a disagreement. We moved around the corner from his mum but the last 6 months it appears she has tried to manipulatively break us up. I’ll give you some examples.

We only ever socialise with her, friends her age, and while we are at those occasions she superficially talks up her son’s talents, and looks, and how special he is.

I live 10 hours away by car, and every time my mom calls to tell me something has happened with him, I feel such guilt. 1. For living far away and feeling helpless. 2. For deciding to not have a relationship with my brother because I feel he is toxic. I want to help, but I don’t know what to do. I go back and forth between feeling like I should reach out to him and then mad that he never reaches out to me. I won’t be a part of a one-sided relationship, especially because he uses my parents and never apologizes.","I live 10 hours away by car, and every time my mom calls to tell me something has happened with him, I feel such guilt. 1.

"My husband and I have been married for almost three years. We dated for over six years before we married. I felt like I knew him so well and we would be fine. I knew he had a temper (at times)but overall he is an amazing person. He really is very loving and kind overall. Sometimes though (more frequently recently) he gets SO angry. He curses at me and calls me names. I feel like he really hates me at those moments. He doesn’t hit me he just yells a lot and I can tell he is FURIOUS! He gets angry when things don’t go his way. His behavior is fine if all is well but if things go downhill just a little (the car breaks down, I’m late for something, or any other inconvenience) he gets angry really easily.

Its getting to the point that my friend gets frustrated with me because I never want to hang out and just want to be alone. This is also not just with my friends its with my family as well.

"I have been with my boyfriend for a over a year now. He had always gone above and beyond for me. We do have an age difference where he is 4 years younger than me. But he has always been very mature and well-spoken for someone his age. Recently we have been experiencing a lot of downfalls in our relationship. He has a very busy schedule and doesn’t make a lot of time for me. We are also long distance, he lives across the country. I’ve been asking for some time to video chat and discuss over some of our issues and he agrees that we should do that as well, but he has not prioritized time for me. I’m feeling very insecure in our relationship because lately when we fight, he doesn’t seem to care. One minute he is expressing how important I am to him and that he loves me. And then the next, he is getting defensive and said that I’m not being considerate and understanding. During our 6th month together, we had a big fight which led to me breaking up with him because I was frustrated with him. He ended up getting drunk that night and told me he kissed one of his female friends. It took me awhile to forgive him and to move past it, but I feel like the feeling of betrayal never really left. He told me he would never do something like that to me again and that it was something stupid that he regrets so much. But I feel like anytime he gets upset with me or we have an argument and he goes out with his friends, I fear he would hurt me again. I don’t know what to do. He isn’t giving me much to work with because I can’t seem to be able to get him to sit down long enough to talk. If he isn’t going to class or studying, he’s working. And that’s almost 7 days out of his schedule packed. What do I do? I love him so much and I want to work past this, but I just feel so defeated. (From Canada)",,No Distortion,

But I have these dreams where I do really disturbing things, I will describe a few of them here. In one I was having sex with the dead body of the girl I have a crush on (I am an in the closet lesbian- idk if that is important), in another I was having sex with a young child in a school bathroom. I do not have any, um, desire to be with corpses or children, but I wake up from these dreams feeling aroused. I would never, ever consider doing anything like that in real life, but is this something I should be concerned about?",,No Distortion,

"I recently finalized a highly contentious divorce with an abusive spouse who used horrific tactics to emotionally abuse me, tear me down, turn people against me, and even take my son away for a period of time (using my mental health as an excuse, which is absolutely not a factor and was exacerbated by him). My parents have been on his side through the entire process and I have essentially cut them out of my life for the time being in order to attempt to heal from all of this. During the last part of our marriage, he used tracking devices on me, routinely went through my personal items and phone, and the divorce process intensified his verbal abuse, where I was regularly gaslighted and berated.",,No Distortion,
"Last night something happened that I’ve never gone through. Me in my bf were in my car and I was mad and frustrated with him(remind you the day before was one of my worst days because I almost broke up with him) so I became so stressed and aggravated. He told me to relax and I slowly started to become light headed and eventually I wasn’t able to move. I felt completely soulless. I wasn’t able to feel anymore and I couldn’t talk. Even my bf said I looked dead it took about 2 hours for me to slowly start moving and talking. I remember I was able to see and hear everything but I couldn’t do anything.

"I used to always just joke about being depressed and hating life, but in the past few months (sparked by bad arguments with my mom, having to put down the dog I’ve had and loved for nearly 12 years, and getting put into a class with a very bad teacher in school), I’ve been getting worse and everything I never dreamed I would actually do/feel/think is becoming a reality. I’ve been thinking about self-harm even though I’ve always found it ridiculous, and my mental breakdowns have been occurring more and more often. I’m more prone to crying out of nowhere or at the slightest mention of something even remotely upsetting to me. I’ve been in two relationships and both of them were terrible, one partner forcing me into sexual activities, and one partner leaving me for someone else while blaming me for the relationship failing. My mom has been switching between being nice to me, ridiculing me, and ignoring me. It makes my already low self-esteem drop even more, and at this point, I’ve learned to ignore her, but It’s still difficult sometimes to tone out her words. My teacher at school doesn’t teach the material but expects us to know how to do it on his level even though we’re beginners (AP Language). He gives everyone bad grades all the time and never praises us when we do good. His lectures to the class are no better than saying we all are terrible students and should be receiving even lower grades. He makes me feel unwanted and going to his class makes me really anxious. I’m currently trying to drop it, but my principal won’t return my emails regarding it. I want to get help, but the other part of me feels like I don’t deserve it. I’ve been surprising myself when it comes to controlling the urges to harm myself or worse, but the urges have been getting more tempting as of late. I haven’t really been feeling any positive emotions lately, but whenever other people are around I subconsciously smile, even when I don’t want to. I hate the way I am now, and I want to get better, but I also don’t want to cause anyone trouble.","My teacher at school doesn’t teach the material but expects us to know how to do it on his level even though we’re beginners (AP Language).

"Hello, I hate my step daughter and don’t want her near my husband, but I need help overcoming these feelings. I have been with my husband for 5 years and my step daughter is now 11 years old. A couple years ago, she started to act out and become disrespectful and lazy. We tried everything to discipline and teach her how to be kind and empathetic, but no improvement was made. At this time, we spoke to her mom and step dad and all agreed she should be tested for a disability. Turns out she has Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), but her mom refuses to consider medication or alternative holistic approaches to helping in this matter. My husband has zero legal right in any medical treatments or therapy until she is 16. Long story short, this last summer she started to put herself in between my husband and I when he would show me affection. We put an end to that quickly and explained that we will not tolerate her jealousy or manipulative tactics to separate us. Recently, she told her grandma that she is scared of me. This resulted in a massive fight between the grandparents and my husband and I. We discussed this matter with the daughter and asked if she was truly scared of me and she said she was joking. She has been saying things like this about her step-dad for years now, however we know he treats her very well and there is no reason for these cruel remarks. She has used manipulation techniques like this for a couple years and started by playing the mom and dad against each other. I have done nothing but accept her into my life and have her become like a real daughter. About a year ago, her behavior started to change and she started displaying annoying and selfish behaviors that upset me greatly. She still expects her father to carry her up the stairs to put her to bed, massage her feet, snuggle with him on the couch, pick out her outfits and be in our bedroom without permission. I feel like she is challenging and competing with me. Every time I am snuggling with my husband on the couch, she immediately comes and lays on his lap and invades my time with her dad. At this point, when I hear her name, my skin crawls and I want nothing to do with her. The only time I argue with my husband is over her. How can I stop hating, detesting and loathing her? She tried to hug me last night and I couldn’t hug her back. I love children and it hurts me to feel this way about a child. Therapy is not an option for us because her mom won’t approve it.

"When I was young, maybe 7 or 8, I was watching Blue Hawaii and there is this scene where Elvis takes this girl over his knee and spanks her because she tried to kill herself by driving into the lake…when I say girl, I guess I really mean young woman. Anyways, ever since I saw that scene, I was really intrigued and curious. I had never seen a man spank a full grown woman. The only thing I could relate spanking to was the abuse that I witnessed my mother perpetrate in my home. But this scene didn’t seem like what my mom did. So anyways after that every time the topic of spanking was broached, I got this feeling of anticipation…like just hearing or reading the word made me excited, for lack of a better word. When I was in 8th grade I started looking at things on the internet that had to do with adult spanking. This led me to the domestic discipline sights that talk about spanking in a relationship. I became engrossed to say the least. I read all the DD stories. And decided that I couldn’t be in a relationship that did not include me getting a sound spanking when I deserved one… Also, another aspect that I think may be relevant is the fact that I have struggled with self injury off and on for 5 years.I was wondering if that somehow correlates with my spanking needs… but the real issue I guess is…is this a healthy expression? Is there something wrong with my desire to be disciplined by my mate?",,No Distortion,
"Hello, What brought me here is that I believe I am a pedophile, I am shocked and anxious about it and disgusted by myself. I’ve been diagnosed with OCD (relationships OCD) 3 years ago and for the past 1,5 years I’ve been struggling with thoughts/fantasies about my gender and possible homosexuality. 6 months ago the worst was added to the roaster – I started to think that I am a pedophile when I felt something that I believe is attraction to a 12 year old girl. It got me panicking and later on I think that my feelings were exaggerated due to anxiety and there was nothing sexual there. But for the past months I’ve been struggling: I do definitely find teenager girls attractive (16 and up mostly) and as far as my research goes there is nothing biologically wrong with it (it’s a grey area in terms of social and legal issues though), plus research shows that many men respond with arousal to teenagers, they just don’t pay as much attention to it as I do due to fears of being a pedophile.",It got me panicking and later on I think that my feelings were exaggerated due to anxiety and there was nothing sexual there.,Magnification,

"My life is currently a disaster. I understand other people have it worse. Physically, I am blessed. I have a roof over my head, food to eat, transportation, a supportive family, an amazing church, and a helpful therapist (who is both a mental health counselor as well as a drug and alcohol counselor) who truly seems to care. During a very recent hospitalization, I also began utilizing a journal to get my thoughts out in a private manner. I have an incredible support system I rarely utilize. I am struggling with a number of issues. I suck at reaching out before making terrible decisions such as self harm and drug use. I am an alcoholic and a drug addict who attends AA meetings regularly but have yet to pick up my 24-hour chip. I feel as if I’m not ready to surrender and work a program. I am, however, terrified of the consequences of alcoholism/drug use. Another fellowship I was previously a member of states these consequences at the start of every meeting: jails, institutions, and death. I lost one of my best friends in March to addiction. I have also seen many others lose their lives. While heroin is not my DOC, I feel as though any substance I choose to use will inevitably lead to some kind of consequence. I am in such a conundrum. That is the only word I can think of to describe this mess known as my life. Following the worst inpatient experience of my life, I am also struggling with the emotional pain of being on a very small amount of numerous medications. I am on the starting doses of these meds which have not nearly reached a therapeutic level. I feel as though I am mentally and emotionally unstable, as is proven by my recent words and actions towards others. This has caused others pull away, possibly permanently. I owe amends I’m not ready to give. As a member of AA, I believe in the ninth step. That is a step I struggled with a lot, though. There were a lot of repeated amends by mouth, but no changed behavior. It was unintentional lip service. I was and still am unsure of how to change my behavior. My next issue has to do with the job I just lost on Monday and the rest of the issues I haven’t discussed that were a result of this volcano that has just erupted. A few weeks ago, I put my two weeks notice in at a job I had worked at for three weeks shy of a year. I was burned out on working with the general public, so going back is not an option. I had just been offered a contracted cleaning job. So for my last two weeks of work at my old job, I worked both jobs. This was not a good decision. I was simultaneously feeling suicidal due to just being put on Latuda. I could not get ahold of my psychiatrist, so after just two weeks of working a brand new job, i found it necessary to go inpatient before I made a fatal decision. Following being inpatient, they told me at my new job that while I had been out of work for two weeks, they had to fill my position. I burned bridges, lost my sponsor as a result of using the day they let me go, and cut myself for the first time in two years. I feel too unstable to try to obtain and maintain employment at this time. I will not be able to pass a drug test at the moment. Not having a job leaves me with a ton of time on my hands. I am torn between applying for SSI and SSD and looking for a new job (in a few weeks.) This leaves me with no income. I am blessed to live with a parent who provides for me. I don’t really understand the point of sharing all of this. I am the one who needs to make some changes and decisions.","While heroin is not my DOC, I feel as though any substance I choose to use will inevitably lead to some kind of consequence.

I say this because while I’ve experienced a lot of personal growth just within the past month, I can’t help but have some concerns. I’ll start by saying that this year has been a lot for me. I dropped out of college in May due to stress that inhibited me from functioning for months after (to this day I’m still trying to get my life back), after months of persistent mood swings, anxiety, and mild psychosis I went to see a psychiatrist in September (I think) that completely dismissed my concerns by saying I had “mild depression and terrible coping skills”;despite me mentioning I’d attempted suicide over 4 times!; which subsequently sent me into a severe depressive episode after the session. My mood never really lifted, and in November, 2 days before my birthday, I broke up with my boyfriend of over a year. The experience in itself was gut-wrenching and the week following even more so. I had a really bad breakdown one night, broke a bunch of things, wanted to kill myself but blacked out before I could do any damage. I figured things would only get worse until the next week when my mood did a complete 180 and I suddenly knew the answers to life, the fact my ex wasn’t talking to me no longer bothered me, I spent over $200 in 2 days (and the rest throughout the following week) etc. etc. (insert various symptoms of mania here). My therapist told me I seemed more bipolar than just depressed but it seems she dropped the diagnosis as she hasn’t mentioned it since our first session and gave me a diagnosis of “anxiety disorder” upon our second meeting. Anyway, the episode of what I’d call mania lasted for basically a month up to the point I was certain I was god and was considering starting my own religion, but then on Christmas night depression slapped me in the face and I’ve been very down ever since.

I got home from work and started feeling terrible. I felt like nothing mattered and that life had no point. Since then I have had difficulty with suicidal thoughts, depersonalization and derealization. Sometimes I feel like part of me is watching over me, and that it wants me to join it in heaven. Other times I get scared when I’m around loved ones because I know they are going to die one day, and that I’ll be left without them. I also get scared that I’m going to die, that I could end my life without realizing I’m doing it.

Since childhood, I have been sexually stimulated by the sight of a woman (and to a lesser extent, a man) going to the bathroom. By that I mean the actually sight of the excretion process, not merely them sitting on a toilet. Also, I am also sexually stimulated by the exhibitionist side of the coin as well.

My mother has many health issues and has not yet been approved for disability and my dad cannot afford things on his own. My fiancé has his own apartment and I want to move in, but I am feeling guilty about it since I give so much to my parents financially, I worry they won’t be able to afford our current house on their own. My fiancé and I are tired of waiting and he is basically giving me a deadline of when I need to move out and stop helping my parents, but I don’t know if they will be financially stable by then. He is tired of waiting and quite frankly, so am I, but I don’t want to see my parents struggle to have a roof over their head and I also do not want to lose my relationship. I feel like this is the ultimate ultimatum. My parents aren’t helping any because they are not trying to help themselves and I just feel like they aren’t trying to make their situation better. The house we are in currently is a rental and they have just been pre-approved for a mortgage but they are dragging their feet in looking for houses, making appointments with a realtor, and so on. It’s like they are putting my life on hold for an indefinite amount of time.

He told me that when he was 21 he got married and by the age of 22 he was divorced. (He is 30 now). Well 6 months ago we got engaged. We told each other that if we make a purchase above $1,000, then we would discuss it with the other person. Next, he wanted to buy a 14k gun. He told me and I told him that if he got it them we would not be on good terms. The seller raised the price so he told me that he was not getting it. We found that he is not divorced. I asked him how did this happen and he told me that she sent him fake papers so he thought everything was taken care of. Plus she told him that she was remarried. Now He has been telling me that he does not trust me with money. I have not made a big purchase or anything. I have told him that money is tight for me but I am in a profession where you get paid a lot. One day, he asked me if my dad could do a certified check (he is a banker). I asked him why he needed that. He told me he wanted to get the gun. The gun that we both agreed that he would not get. Finally he tells me that he wanted to ask his dad before he told me that he wanted to get the gun. The next day, I find out that he knew that he was married before we were even together. He even told me that the girl he dated once he told her that he is still married and she is fine with it. What to do? The wedding is in 7 months. (From the USA)",,No Distortion,

I always stayed in kindergarden and elementary school until 5 or 6 pm, my only friend was my older sister and there the friendship came almost only from my side, because she had friends of her own and I was a bother. In 6th grade people first started talking to me, and I didn’t know what to do or how to react to the things they did, I am still not sure sometimes. I first started paying attention to the people around me. Everyone else was intense to me, I didn’t know what to do when they were in a certain mood. I am not even sure how to handle the emotions of my sister. When someone cried, others came to them, they worried and tried to comfort them. I could look at the crying kid as long as I wanted, I didn’t really feel anything. But it is not like I didnt feel anything. I am pretty sure I feel as much as everyone else, just at the wrong place and wrong time. I don’t talk with my parents about it, I think I bother them.

When people actually talk to me, which almost never happens, I don’t know what they actually want from me, even if they perfectly articulate themselves.

"For nearly two years, I’ve dealt with increasingly worse anxiety symptoms. The biggest issue is my inability to sleep when I am away from home, including difficulties sleeping in my own dorm. I’ve dealt with these sleeping issues for over a year and generally find that when I can’t sleep, my mind focuses on all the things wrong with the room I’m in (too quiet, too hot, etc). I’m also constantly going through a mental list of assignments, meetings, and events, and rewriting the list in my planner each day. Usually, I just run through the list in my head, but I have also noticed that I will speak out loud to myself while walking to and from class and run through the list while making a plan of what order to complete those tasks. I’ll run through this order multiple times, typically until I get to wherever I’m going or encounter other people because I’m worried they will judge me for speaking to myself. Even when I’ve accomplished the tasks I set out to do on a particular day, I still find myself thinking about the items on that list and panicking about how much more I have to do. As a result, I feel as if I can never fully relax.

"I have been taking paroxetine oral suspension for a month now after being diagnosed with depression and social anxiety. I started from a very low dose of 1 mg and then augmented by 1 mg every two days, so that now I’m taking 13 mg daily. As far as cons go, I have experienced a significant emotional bluntness, some nausea, and until recently an augmented feeling of drowsiness during most of the day. As for the pros, I’m a little less angry (and a bit more sad) and I’ve had less trouble getting asleep (but I sleep more, too much probably).",,No Distortion,
"3 weeks ago, I went to my very first psychiatrist appointment. It was a pretty big milestone for me as I haven’t been in contact with any mental health professional since I was 15, and I was really looking forward to finally getting the help I need. The whole experience was dissatisfactory overall, from filling out forms in the waiting room, to waiting for the doctor to actually come in for hours, I had switched from anxious but hopeful to frustrated and wishing I could just get it over with. Eventually, she (the psychiatrist) called me in and we talked for no more than 5 minutes. She asked me many questions but by the end she was completely dismissive about everything I confided in her about and ushered me out the door saying “I am a psychiatrist, I deal with people who have REAL problems, which you do not have, just bad coping skills.” Ah, yes, “bad coping skills”. I left with only one question in my mind: If I don’t have any problems, what do you think those bad coping skills come from? To say I was upset upon my arrival at home would be a massive understatement. It took everything within me to not express my rage. I wanted to scream, I wanted to cut, I wanted to burn my entire house down even if it meant death to my whole family just so I could die in it – but that’s not me. I hate bringing others into my personal problems. And so, I crashed into an extreme depressive episode in which I spent the evening crying for 7 hours, didn’t get out of bed for days, didn’t eat for more than a week (I’m only recently starting to eat at least one meal a day) and spent every waking moment feeling like I need to jump off a bridge because even the thought of my own existence makes me feel incurably sick to the stomach and pained in the head. Currently, I’m doing significantly better, and aim to contact a new therapist within the next week or so, but that initial experience is something I doubt I’ll ever forget, but honestly, I just wonder what’s the purpose of it all, as my desire for escape from existence runs its course, even when I’m not in any way depressed at all.

"My wife (age 39) has past history of depression followed by several months’ therapy long time back. Lately once every year for the past 3 years for about a period of 2-4 months each year, she has been showing some severe behavioral responses to stressful situations. For normal people, these may not seem stressful situations usually, like house hunting, work load at college, arguments among couples, etc. But often when the stress remains for several days, especially with doing something new, she starts showing various reactions, like sadness, complete change in personality from a jovial one to a quiet depressive one, with a constant facial expression showing emotional hurt, withdrawal from normal activities, complete loss of sexual drive, aversion of eye contact, responding in frustrated way to normal questions, irregular sleep or lack of sleep, irregular eating schedules, complete lack of compassion. Taking one example, she started studying with a seemingly normal mood. She was unable to find a word for her work, which made her extremely frustrated. Even my inability to help with that word was met by seeming skepticism as if I wasn’t actually trying to help. After 3 hours, she got up with a sad expression, complete silence, averting eye contact, and saying good night in a frustrated dejected way and retiring for the day. On normal days she is a very loving person, but she is not a threat to anybody even during the bad days. However, her reactions were more severe 3 years ago, with tendencies to cry all day, sitting in the dark corner of a room, shivering, inability to talk, facial spasms. These don’t happen often and is never visible to anybody outside home. But there is always an underlying chance that any severe condition or normal arguments may trigger her reactions. Somehow, such stressful situations arose exactly once each of these 3 years, and hence that many reaction phases. However she is smart and completely aware of everything and hence not willing to see a professional. My question: What exactly is it that can be going on with her?Is there a name for this?Are there materials that I can read and show her to persuade her to take help? Is there really a treatment? Is it actually a disorder or something else? Please help. This affects daily life and normal relationships at home. (From the USA)",,No Distortion,

"Hi, In the past month my girlfriend experienced something strange four times. She was in a manipulative/emotionally abusive relationship that lasted 9 years, and ended recently. She’s been struggling because of it, and I’ve been helping her. She self-harmed, had suicidal thoughts, and attempted suicide. When things got overly stressful, she had anxiety attacks where she would convulse(?)–still conscious, barely being able to talk, but her entire body tensed up and standing still, especially her feet and hands. They lasted around 10 minutes, and she’d feel sore afterwards. She’s been getting better, being happier as time passes and able to deal with things better. But just recently, when something that reminds her of traumatic experiences happened, she’d go in a “trance.” For example, I accidentally said something her ex would say, and she took it the wrong way, as if it was manipulative and blaming her for something I did. She started staring into nothingness. When trying to talk to her, she’d either not react, or barely say anything. When trying to touch her, she’d look very scared and pull away, telling me not to touch her. When asking her to tell me my name, she’d say her ex’s name. When doing nothing, she’d just stare into nothing, staying still. When getting too close, she’d react rashly to get away and tell me to stay away. After a while of trying to snap her out of it, she’d walk away into another room, often the bedroom. Last time, she went to the washing machine, then the bedroom, and told me to stop asking her what my name was, that I always do that, even though it was the first time during that “trance” that I asked. So she’s at least minimally aware of her surroundings, and the trances may be connected? During those four times, she was unconscious, seemed extremely traumatized, and thought I was her ex. It lasts 15-20 minutes. She snaps back (once after I made her say my actual name a few times, another after I kept telling her I loved her she shed a tear and snap back, the last one after she fell asleep for a couple of minutes) and doesn’t remember anything whatsoever. She feels empty, but in an okay mood, like nothing happened. I’d like to now what’s happening, and if it’s dangerous in any way.

"Is there a list available of character traits, habits and/or actions which would indicate in a general sense a psychological issue? ie: The person never shows embarrassment.

Gifts are often not age related/appropriate such as giving a small child-sized gift to an older adolescent or teenager.

"From a teen in the U.S.: As of late I’ve noticed some startling changes in myself. I’ve always been a clear minded person, one who wasn’t easily distracted, and I’ve always had a good memory of things. As of recently (the last few months), I’ve been stuck in a mental fog. I can’t think clearly, or understand simple concepts anymore. I feel as though there’s a wall blocking me from mentally going past it, and trying to get past it only makes the confusion and fogginess worse. I can’t remember things I used to remember– like important events or things that were told to me minutes beforehand.

When we were young she was mentally and physically abusive to me, insulting me if I came near, and hitting or pushing me down if I was within reach. Our parents tried to address this themselves, but finally just told me I couldn’t change her and to stay away from her.

"Am I Potentially Mentally Ill? Hi, I’m 17-year-old girl and I’m worried that I might have Asperger’s syndrome and some other illness, but I don’t know which one. Firstly, I want to say that I always knew that I’m different from others. even when I was little I had trouble to fit in because I didn’t know how to normally communicate. every time I meet people I don’t talk or I talk like a crazy. I also dress up little different, so every one first thought is that this girl is weird. I have had 5 friend in my life and now just left two. others grew up like normal kids so I became too weird for them. even when I was in first grades in school teachers were forcing others to talk with me because when other were playing I was just drawing, not even paying attention. I’m not even going to mention my obsessions, weird talks about subjects that no one cares about. everyone was calling me philosopher. I also could never consider someone’s eyes I just improved that a year ago. also, I show many other symptoms except maybe not understanding what are people telling me. sometimes my grandma and mum tell me that I’m like a brick not understanding what people tell me but I don’t really know why are they saying it. this is my suspicion about Asperger, but what I really worry about is delusions. when I was 14 or so I was convinced that I am a werewolf even though I don’t believe in them. I believed it so much I would do stupid things like I would eat raw meat (which is funny because I don’t like meat), having dreams about me shapeshifting and if I would discover little scratch next morning it was because it really happened. I even had “hallucinations”. in the mirror, I could see my eyes turning yellow. it was much worse than it sounds. this ended in a year or 2. but then next started. I believed I was a medium and I was literally seeing auras and ghosts (which is also funny because I don’t believe in them). I could hear voices and breath. and this ended in a few months. there is something about aliens but I don’t consider it important. PS parents don’t believe me.

I also did not approach her by asking her in that way. When I was a really young child, I use to get in trouble by my parents from touching myself.

"I had a highly traumatic childhood of emotional abuse, smothering, and neglect at the hands of a substance-abusing parent. I was also molested through my diaper by older children as a toddler. I believe these led to the development of my severe, chronic dissociate disorder and OCD. I say all this for context, not as an excuse. As a kid, I had horrible violent and sexually deviant intrusive thoughts as well as PGAD in conjunction with them. I hated them and wanted nothing to do with them and tried to suppress them, but was convinced I was evil. Therapy has helped me realize they weren’t my fault back then. However, as a teen, I decided those thoughts were inevitable and began to let awful scenarios play out in my head instead of rejecting them and masturbated to some of them. I found online communities of people who shared these thoughts but considered them harmless “kinks” when explored only through fiction. I never intended to act on any of them and considered them divorced from my true opinions, but now I see they were still affecting me and I want nothing to do with them. I don’t believe an immoral fantasy can be harmless anymore. I became hyper-sexual and a chronic masturbator. My twin cousins who are 7 years younger than me slept in my room when they visited my house. I was around 15-17. When I knew they had fallen asleep, I silently masturbated. It happened a couple times. I think they were asleep and I don’t think they knew, but it haunts me everyday and the remorse and self-disgust I feel is indescribable. It had nothing to do with their presence, I just wanted to orgasm, but it was SO irresponsible of me no matter how careful I was. In the only other instance of this, I once compulsively touched myself through my pants in an upstairs room of their house, only for a sec, planning to stop before anyone entered. One of them walked in unexpectedly and I was mortified, but pretended I just had an itch, apologized, and went to wash my hands. I don’t know if I can tell my therapist, but it’s eating me alive. I don’t know if these instances count legally as indecency to a minor. If so, I’m ready to turn myself in. I want to kill myself.","I don’t know if I can tell my therapist, but it’s eating me alive.

"Hi. So I was diagnosed with Bipolar about 5 years ago. I haven’t been medicated in a while due to the fact I don’t have the funds to meet with a psychiatrist to get the correct prescription. I’ve been doing well without medication and I don’t believe I am experiencing a high or low mood, but I’ve started to notice something else that has become a major concern for me. For the past few weeks I’ve been hearing voices that aren’t my own. These voices do not speak to me, they sound more so like someone else talking behind my own thoughts. If I try to focus on the voices when they appear I can’t, they slowly fade away so I can’t really get an idea of what they say. These voices appear during the day and at night while laying down so they arent specific to a tired state. I have never experienced psychosis or hallucinations before and from my knowledge if hallucinations were to appear wouldn’t they be from depression or mania, not a pretty stable mood? Could there be another cause for these voices I’m hearing? I’ve been rather stressed recently due to college starting again but that is the only change in my routine/life recently. My main concern is that these voices aren’t a cause of my bipolar but a whole new illness (maybe schizophrenia) starting to present itself.",My main concern is that these voices aren’t a cause of my bipolar but a whole new illness (maybe schizophrenia) starting to present itself.,Overgeneralization,

"I’m prone to overreacting every once in a while, I’ll usually throw a fit in my room at night and try to be quiet (hitting pillows, crying, screaming into pillows) which I’m sure is ordinary.

At school, I feel uncomfortable if people try to sit next to me at lunch, so I sit on my own and read, and this doesn’t bother me at all! But my mother thinks I’m hurting myself (socially), but she doesn’t seem to understand how strained I feel when I’m put into a situation I don’t like. On the other hand, when I do feel chatty, I always seem to mention topics that aren’t related, or I steer the conversation towards me, or I’m unintentionally mean. I try to remind myself not to behave that way, but every time I talk it seems like I mess everything up. I think about things no one else really cares about. I’m not sure if my personality is weird or if something is actually going on with my brain that doesn’t happen with everyone else, because even introverts (i think) have their own little group of friends to sit with, even if they don’t talk, but I feel stifled and nervous when I haven’t started talking on my own terms. I’ve started noticing that I take nudges and pushes a little too seriously, and when I try to replicate that playful atmosphere with my siblings I end up hurting them or angering them. Everyone gives me a hard time because of it. My siblings make me feel guilty. Once I had politely declined an offer from a nice girl who wanted me to come and sit with her and her friends, and when I later on related it to my mother, she was upset that I didn’t accept the offer and told me that I wasn’t going to make many friends if I was rude like that. There’s also the fact that I act a lot like a child and can be loud and annoying, and I feel like I interrupt people all the time.

"My mom and dad recently got divorced. I have one sister who is 19 and lives 2 hours away at college and they told us together in January when we were visiting her that they were getting a divorce. I am fine with that my sister didn’t speak to our family for a month or two and this march I thought my mom was up to something and I told my dad my suspicions and he tried to dismiss them but I couldn’t let it go so I dug around a bit. I suspected she had cheated on my dad and was still with this guy. I drove by my mom’s house one night and saw a random car there around midnight, and it was still there at 5 AM the next morning. I noticed this about 6 other times. I hid a voice recorder in my mom’s house and played it back and I heard things no child should hear. His name is Rick and he is getting divorced too and he and my mom are in a relationship. That and a few unmentionable things are what I learned from the recording. I told my dad and he said he found out earlier in the year from a PI he hired and when they signed the divorce document my mom told him everything. He told me what he knew and my mom has been seeing this guy for 10 years and she isn’t planning on telling my sister or I, nor does anyone on my mom’s side of the family know… they never will. SO basically, my mom doesn’t know I know and my dad only disses my mom with me and I don’t show anyone how bad it hurts me. I can’t tell my sister because she would literally leave my family and it’s not my place to tell her, but secretly I wish she had gone through it too so someone could feel the pain I feel and so I could have someone to talk to, I know that’s awful. My dad can’t see it hurts because I have to be there for him. This divorce broke him and he has become my bff through it and I can’t be weak I have to be strong for him. I can’t stand my mom now that I know the truth. She lies about EVERYTHING and its so easy to see the truth.

"I’m a mom of a 6 y.o., and stepmom to a 9 y.o. with ADHD, and a 7 y.o. who is violent, short tempered and manipulative. He has no problem with lying on a daily basis. His mother is a drug addict and prostitute. He is not fully aware of her issues, but is aware of her pathological lying.He is very intelligent in “book-related” things, such as reading and mathematics. Other than that, he is below par. He shows little to no respect for the rights of others. He has made up stories of children being molested in the classroom, and other stories to get others in trouble and show how “good” he is. He has stolen and “coveted” things that do not belong to him. He lies so much, I assume everything he says is untrue. He will attack the other two boys on a daily basis for the slightest percieved ‘wrong’. If he does not get what he wants, when he wants it (litterally), he will fake-cry (it is obviously fake) for up to an hour. For example, when his father comes home from work, the child immeadiately will ask for a quarter and a trip to the store so he can spend it on a gum ball machine. After the tooth brushing bed time routine he will continue asking for something to eat (even though he had a snack before brushing) untill his dad gives in or he is carried, crying and faking injuries to his bed. He seems to not understand at all that the rules also apply to him, “because he gets good grades in school”.

"Lately I’ve been feeling like nothing is going right in my life and I’m just too tired to deal with it. I go to boarding school and my relationship with my parents has been deteriorating because they limit my freedom a lot when I’m at home by not letting me go out and my mom especially manipulates me into doing things her way all the time. When things don’t go her way she sometimes blows up at me and yells at me calls me a failure and says she doesn’t want to talk to me or care for me. I’ll spend whole days just in my room and she’ll pretend I’m not there. These episodes have occurred every few months for my whole life but lately it’s been several times a month. I’ve started to keep aspects of my personal/academic life to myself because I just want to avoid this kind of situation. For example, I’m working on a research project that I’m very stressed about but I didn’t tell my mom because she would get stressed and we’d end up yelling at each other. I was also dating someone and I didn’t tell them because I didn’t want to get yelled at. But then about a month ago is when everything kind of fell apart. My boyfriend broke up with me because his personal life was also falling apart and he couldn’t commit to a relationship. Initially, I accepted this answer but later I couldn’t shake the suspicion that he was just lying to make me feel better and that he just didn’t like me anymore. That some things about me were off-putting to him. Then my research project just kept hitting dead ends while everyone else’s seemed to be progressing. Then a few days ago I accidentally caused an evacuation by burning Teflon plastic and creating highly toxic fumes in the lab. The teacher keeps bringing it up and I sometimes have to try not to cry when he does. This has made all my self-loathing and guiltiness and embarrassment worse and I feel like I’m failing academically and also failing as a person. Am I just bad at handling life?

Crikey the dangers of opioids were the focus of a long running TV series (House), and post successful long running “DARE” educational programs, the opioid epidemic is an excuse by pharma/politicians to generate billions of PROFIT. And cartel gangs like MS-13 just exacerbated the situation/access as did the opioid bill. Hospital inpatient wards, like Sentara are all about increasing revenue/profit as well, to cut expensive nursing staff, they now have one co-ed locked ward that combines abused/trauma/MDD patients with criminals detoxing before they go to jail. There is no actual individual or group therapy, there are techs who act just as babysitters. The MDs forget to write prescriptions, and are masters of the $400 handshake. Criminals/addicts stay free get top quality concierge care, eating disorders, MDD, PTSD get screwed via $10,000 2 night stay/hold for NO CARE just when they needed a thorough health/psych eval to determine if/what other pharma based treatments might be more effective –and the therapist at the medical school said the only way was via inpatient. These are worse health care conditions than those that existed 30-50 years ago. Bottom line, addicts and autism are it. No one gives a fig about anyone else. Do you think this will ever change?

"I am in a relationship with a 49 yoa male who has not had a lasting relationship in 19 years. He is a realist, recovering alcohol of 25 yrs, does not believe in Western Medicine and speaks the truth about everything regardless of feelings. We have had challenges from day one but the most recent challenge is that he has enacted stipulations that we will not attend public events together, we will not eat at restaurants together, we will not attend a movie together, etc – all because he believes I am unable to control my behavior/emotions. For example, we attended an event in which I ran into a male who had caused a serious injury to myself in which I almost lost a leg. I have not seen this male since the final court date.The male dragged out things out for years causing me more money and frustration to collect on his criminal restitution. Yes, I was surprised to see him at the event, told my bf who the male was and expressed disgust of seeing him again. I did not approach the male or speak to him. The whole incident/my behavior last possibly 5 mins before I collected myself and went back to having a good time. Since that event, my bf believes I have anger issues and can not be trusted to “stay in the moment” with him therefore he will not attend any more events with me because he “will not put himself” in that situation again. Nothing I did or said should have affected my bf therefore I am confused to say the least. He explained it as why should he feel uncomfortable or give support to me for something I should have dealt with already. He does not want to go to the movies because I once mentioned I was uncomfortable in the seats however we have since gone to two movies with the new seating and I have been fine. He knows that but for some reason has decided all of sudden to issue this stipulation. I believe this is controlling manipulative behavior, possibly passive aggressive and punishment for things I may have done or said that he will not forgive me for.

"This feels kinda stupid but I know I need help? I’ve slowly lost touch with everyone in my life, including my whole family. I have exams coming up and everyone expects me to do amazing but I can’t. I can barely find energy to get up in the morning. there are times when I feel like crying, even though there’s nothing wrong. I’ve always got a headache, or stomach ache, or just generally feel ill. I think I hate myself and this makes me hate everyone else too. I feel like I’m ‘digging my own grave’. I talked to someone honestly, and she basically told me to ‘suck it up’. Sometimes I wonder if she’s right though, maybe its just me being a twat. Recently, I’ve buried myself in all the fantasy worlds in tv shows. My whole family seems more complete without me, and just generally happier. The friends I used to have got left behind as I moved schools, and I ended up with the popular kids. I just don’t wanna cry anymore. I’m just so tired. and I can’t talk to anyone. my parents think I’m crazy, and I’m making stuff up. they’re too busy with my siblings to even notice me half the time. sometimes I wonder if they wish they didn’t have me. I’ve also gained a lot of weight. it sucks. I’m taller than my own dad like is that even possible? and fat. I’ve tried working out… I look like an idiot. I just want to leave everywhere, but that isn’t possible. I’ve been brought up as a Christian, but sometimes it feels like even god doesn’t want me. I went to a retreat, and came back happy and refreshed. no matter how much I pray I cant get it back. it seems like whatever I do now I always wrong. I’m so sick of being here. sometimes I wish I could just sleep till I’m old. talking to people makes me feel like an attention seeker, begging them to notice me. but I need their help, I don’t know how to ask for it. Everyone keeps asking me if I’m alright, apart from my parents. I thought they were the people who were meant to notice you and know you the best? I always say sure I’m okay but I literally don’t know. I wanna leave home.

"Hi there, I’ve been in a relationship for 6 months with my boyfriend and honestly this is my first  real relationship. I know I have room to grow but what he has expressed to me is that I have inappropriate emotional dependent relationships with my friends. I disagree and of course I get upset with him if he says harsh things about them which then he counters that I am not loyal to him and I should just accept his brash, rude remarks (because he’s right?). For example he says all my friends are stupid, and they are going nowhere. Most of my friends are actors and like me we are figuring it out, the business is not easy. I tell him if that if he respected me he would not talk about the people I care about that way- which then he counters that I’m more emotionally invested in them. Furthermore we’ve fought about me having gay guy friends, he says its not because they are gay but because they don’t stand for what we are trying to build together. He then just recently said it’s because they are male and I shouldn’t have any male friends, that he should be the only man in my life. I’m not so attached to my guy friends but him saying all this makes me uncomfortable. I don’t see why if my relationships are strictly platonic that I have to cut them off. My bottom line fear is that he’s being controlling. I KNOW he loves me very much and out of respect to me he would cut any of his friends off if I did not like them but I would never do that! (unless extreme circumstances) And he does not see any of his girl friends any more. I’m scared to talk to him about this again because he will think I care more about my friends then him (something he is always saying) and end the relationship.

All that I needed was a yes from my parents. When I brought it up, my mom was on board, initially, but asked me to speak to my father about it. She then told me that she was less comfortable with the trip because I haven’t been with my boyfriend for long enough. When I asked my dad about it, he was initially concerned with the distance and length of the trip, because I do get anxious at times and can have panic attacks.

I don’t feel guilty or sorry for people and I knew it wasn’t normal for a boy at the age of 7 to be obsessed with murder and crime and killers. I knew I had to adapt and not draw attention to myself. So I created what you could say an act, a fake person. A role I had to commit to in order to seem as though I conformed, that I fit in. However, as i got older, I began to become cold and bitter but had to hide it. I wouldn’t say I’m a psychopath or anything of the sorts. I do share some similar attributes, for example I’m good at manipulating people, I’m smarter than average and I suppose in some senses i am fairly narcissistic though it pains me to say.

There were multiple occasion where I would twist his arm to make him cry, the crying would irritate me and I would twist it more because of this. Unfortunately I broke his arm one time (This my parents found out about of course). I don’t want any judgement on this please. The baby was only maybe 8 months old and of course I am disgusted by what I did but I’m looking for insight not j udgement. The last sadistic behavior I remember was at about 10-11 years old. One of my cats gave birth to 4 kittens and I am pretty sure I caused the death of all four. I would be in the room on my own and I would press down on their stomachs to make them squeal. Although they never died on the spot they passed away pretty quickly and I am sure I caused some major internal injuries. I remember some of the moments very clearly but what I remember mostly was the guilt. In particular when my brother would scream in pain I would have the feeling wash over me instantly and I would keep doing it for some reason. It was the same feeling I got from telling him that his mam and dad weren’t ever coming back (Parents gone in to the shop, me and brother in the car) I will finish up by saving that I consider my self a normal young adult right now. I have some issues with anxiety but I put that down to smoking grass. But I’m just wondering if this behavior as a child could manifest itself again in my later years when my mental health starts to deteriorate. P.S I have a great relationship now with my family and stepfather who actually provided my mum with two more kids after this. They mean the world to me so I’m curious as to where this behavior stemmed.",I know I should seek proper counseling and not ask questions online but I’m curious to hear your opinions on the matter.,Should statements,

"Inside of this fleshy prison live the three of us: Harry, George, and me. Normally, we get along perfectly, each respecting one another’s problems, such as George’s ‘depression’ and Harry’s ‘schizophrenia’ (both of which have not been diagnosed or discussed with a professional). Unlike the other two, I seemingly lack a few emotions, such as grief, remorse, and empathy. Normally, this is more of a strength than a weakness, but as of late, it has been rather difficult to deal with. It’s perfectly normal for me to experience urges to kill living creatures or to break inanimate objects, and these urges are understood by Harry and George. However, with each passing day these urges seem to grow stronger, and Harry and George seem to grow more…’on edge’. When we discuss the subject, the others seem to react with more fear, or aggression, than they used to, and they don’t seem to understand my situation as well as they used to. Previously, I could control my urges perfectly. I fidget a lot, which used to calm the urges, and I can also be quite destructive if I want something (I chewed through a television remote so that I could play with the rubber buttons inside), which also helped. Leaving windows open and then killing the insects that entered the house was another good way to calm myself. However, none of these methods seem to do much good anymore. I want something more, something bigger. Hunting is out of the question for me – there isn’t anywhere to go in my local area and if I ask an adult it will arouse suspicion (they all believe that Harry, George, and myself are a singular, ‘normal’ entity). With each day these urges growing stronger, I also grow more impatient and frustrated with tiny details. Things – and people – are bothering me more and more, and this is encouraging my fantasies of killing them. There’s only two people I would never be able to kill, and they’re not a part of my family, which means I have to control myself greatly each day around the people I’m supposed to ‘love’. With all of that said, it brings me onto my questions. What can I do to calm my desire to kill? And, lastly, is calming my urges that only way to make Harry and George feel comfortable with me again?

I do not yell at them either as I do not have the courage to face a fight. Also, it would only worsen the situation. Instead, if he spoke for him, they would be always forgive their son.

"I am having ongoing difficulties in getting heard and am feeling really discouraged to the point that I don’t want to bother trying to communicate or assert as I feel it doesn’t work anyhow. I’ve done numerous communication, assertiveness and conflict resolution courses and use the suggested techniques (outline the facts, stating the feeling, wants and at times a positive or negative consequence using neutral language, I statements, asking the other person/s what they think, what would work etc). But I don’t get heard. At work I don’t get taken seriously by a colleague I work with on a joint project, my asserted work needs & suggestions get ignored. I’ve discussed this with my manager asking I be included on planning meetings they have explaining I could raise my work needs & suggestions & I work better when I have the context rather than be given bits of work. I make many suggestions of how I can contribute meaningfully on work projects but am getting more & more admin work. I wasn’t employed to do full time admin but in a skilled role needing qualifications. I’ve done work I’ve been given well & enthusiastically. I’d like to discuss this concern with my manager but fear I won’t get heard as nothing has changed when I’ve discussed things with my manager in the past. I coordinate a group, we meet to agree on dates & events for the year. At times have people cancel at the last minute meaning an event has been cancelled. I’ve face to face & via email asked that they advise they can’t come as soon as they know so that as much notice of an event cancellation can be given to give the 1-2 who can make it time to make other arrangements & avoid last minute disappointment. I’ve phrased this by giving the facts, acknowledging things come up but to advise ASAP, the impact of last minute event cancellations on others especially hosts but there are still last minute cancellations. I’d suggested people feel free to arrange additional impromptu events but said if someone were to do so please RSVP quickly either way otherwise no one will want to organize anything if no one responds. The other week I’d issued an invitation to have only 1 person acknowledge it. With initiating new friendships I’m so discouraged there as despite joining many things I feel afraid to initiate things as people often say no they are too busy. So I target activities that are ongoing so I have contact with the same people so friendships build slowly without initiating too early to be knocked back. In past workplaces I’m often not included in pub invites or lunches with others who do a similar job. Advising I know of such events and would be interested in being invited doesn’t work. I hence now feel awkward and shy, not wanting join in informal activities (e.g. invite myself to sit and chat to the other tenants in my block of flats who sit int he front garden) preferring more formal structured activities. I’m at a dead end here. I’ve been to therapy, been told I have good communication skills, I have no personality disorders. I’m generally positive, well presented, interested in others, talk about a wide range of things, keen to get out there. I don’t bitch or say negative things about people. I’ve worked hard on communication and assertiveness.

"I’m a 25 year-old male whose father and cousins have/had schizophrenia. I recently moved to Oregon, where marijuana is a legal drug, so I partake recreationally (3-4 times a week). I just started smoking marijuana when I was 24, and really didn’t make it a regular thing until I was 25. I’ve always had a slight fear of having schizophrenia, as I’ve studied mental illness since it’s been a very big part of my life. Recently, however, I feel those feelings have been slightly amplified due to the correlative nature between schizophrenia and marijuana usage displayed in medical and psychological studies. I’ve noticed myself becoming paranoid when under the influence (a common thing, I know). That paranoia usually subsides after I rest, along with the influence of the drug. That being said, I’ve been having some thoughts of being able to change the world. These thoughts occur heavily when I’m high, but also sometimes happen when I’m sober (only much less intense), and usually come in the form of being able to educate people about empathy and kindness (since I’m a teacher and an actor). I’ve also had moments where I try to empathize with people in order to understand what they’re thinking, and maybe even try to “read their thoughts” in order to better connect with them. Do I truly believe I can? No. But I do think I can come close to identify how their feeling in order to better help them with their problems. I can, somewhat frequently, also have quick mood changes into anger depending on circumstances; they usually happen when I’m driving or when I have a lot of stress in my life.","I’ve also had moments where I try to empathize with people in order to understand what they’re thinking, and maybe even try to “read their thoughts” in order to better connect with them.",Mind Reading,

I grew up in another country and moved to the UK when I was 18, and met my bf soon after I moved to the uk.

However, I have always been someone that makes friends easily, I never have any issue with anyone and generally I would say I’m pleasant person. But for some reason some of his school friends were not welcoming to me. perhaps I was seen as an outsider, (I’m European), or as someone a bit different. but me and him are very happy together. Over the years I’ve heard from some of his friends that they had “heard I was a horrible person and heard bad things about me from other people”, and the people were always people I’d never met, and it was just girls or bitchy people that my bf went to school with. I never understood it, but it really did hurt my feelings because as I said before I’m an open-minded and friendly person, and don’t think I’ve experienced people just randomly saying horrible things about me behind my back. we have a great friendship group with lots of his and my friends, and we all get on really well. however, I’m surprised and hurt that he would go to this event next weekend considering there will be people there that clearly have some strange vendetta against me that I can’t explain, nor do I know where it stems from. he says it shouldn’t matter to me, but it does.this is a big deal for me and I’m surprised he would walk over me like this. should I be hurt or just accept that he wants to go to this school reunion? he sees his friends all the time, so it’s not really a “reunion”. thank you (From the UK)","however, I’m surprised and hurt that he would go to this event next weekend considering there will be people there that clearly have some strange vendetta against me that I can’t explain, nor do I know where it stems from. he says it shouldn’t matter to me, but it does.this is a big deal for me and I’m surprised he would walk over me like this",Magnification,

"I will try and be as brief as possible: 3.5 yrs ago I fell deeply in love with a man who is 13 years my senior. I had never felt this way and neither had he. We were together full time for 1.5 yrs however it was a long distance relationship taking up to 10 hours each way to see each other. We adored each other and wanted to make it work so made an effort to meet up every 2 weeks. The distance took its toll and when I felt ready to move in with him, he suddenly became very scared (his mum committed suicide 3 yrs before I met him and was quite abusive to him when he was a child) and took a step back which caused no end of heart ache. I knew he still loved me however it was simply impossible to continue as we were. Eventually the frustration of being apart caused us to separate. We decided to take a break- not to break up. But he went into denial and although we were in touch most days during the break, he said that he wanted to stay single. I was dying of heartache and 6 months after our so called break met another man who for the first few months became just a lovely friend, consoling me about my break and helping me, eventually the new chap and I started having a relationship although I had mentioned nothing to the first man (love of  my life) as in my head I thought he no longer wished to be together. After some time he found out and told me that he wanted to get back together by which time my trust had flown out the window.

" Hi! I’m a young teen, and I have depression, that I suppose is kinda severe, General and Social anxiety. Around 2 years ago I was put on anti depressants, which have worked pretty well. Around a year ago, I abruptly stopped taking them without really telling anyone. I’m not really sure why, but I did. This was around the holidays, and I was on vacation with family friends in a vacation house owned by some of their relatives. Now, it was a beach house, and, being the middle of winter and family meant that it had not been cleaned beforehand. I was originally sleeping with my friend, but moved to my mom’s bed. My father passed away when I was 9, which caused some underlying anxiety to get worse, along with the typical grief and depression. I slept ok for the first night, but on the second night, I could not relax. It was storming, and an outside swinging door was banging on the wall. This put me on edge. There was one or two old stains on the sheets, and because of that, I started picturing bed bugs or whatever in the bed. (Not hallucinating, just imagining). I then started to get the “bugs crawling on you” feeling, and started sobbing and babbling nonsense. I tend to do that when I get panicked. After around 15 or so minutes, my mom gave me my prescribed lorazapram, and I calmed down and went to sleep. The worst part was when I was on the 5 or so hour drive home. We have a minivan, and I like to sit in the way back to have more space to spread out. My younger sister, 9 at the time, was sitting in front of me.

I believe I may have BPD, because I’ve always had many problems with abandonment, instability of relationships and mood swings, and I also meet all the symptoms of the disorder(even substance abuse and self harm).I’ve always had a confuse sense of identity,I’ve never really known who I was, and experienced dissociation and depersonalisation since the age of 11.

She’s a childish girl who is always cheerful and behave like a psycho,I can sense her voice in my head(not like an hallucynation, just an inner voice different from mine – sometimes we have conversations)that always suggests me to do impulsive things like beating the ones who treat me badly or saying mean things.There are days when something happens and I start to feel anxious, so she takes control and I start to act so differently that the people around me ask me if I’m high or something. Since Chrissie appeared I made some researches and learnt about DID.

"I am having a difficult time dealing with my past abusive relationship. My ex, who I was with for two years was emotionally and sexually abusive. I ended the relationship almost a year ago but am still having a hard time. I occasionally have flashbacks and get frightened or angry and cant stop thinking about what happened. I feel guilty for being so upset because there are other people whose experiences are so, so much worse than mine, but I am still having a hard time getting over it. I am now with a really amazing man who knows about what happened. He really tries to be supportive, but has a difficult time understanding. He gets angry because he doesn’t understand why I allowed someone to do that to me for so long. He thinks that I stayed for so long because I actually enjoyed being sexually abused, and although he doesn’t mean to, he makes me feel like he thinks I am disgusting. He also says that it feels dirty and wrong to instigate anything intimate with me, because unless I initiate it, he feels like I won’t tell him if it’s something I don’t want. He tries so hard to keep me from feeling like I have to do anything and is so worried about making me feel the way that my ex did that I’m afraid to tell him when something he does triggers me, because even though I assure him he has done nothing wrong, he still feels like it’s his fault. I don’t know how to talk to him without us both feeling like horrible people and I don’t know how to get over what happened when I feel like it’s invalid for me to be upset at all about what happened, since it wasn’t as bad as what many people experience.","He thinks that I stayed for so long because I actually enjoyed being sexually abused, and although he doesn’t mean to, he makes me feel like he thinks I am disgusting.

"Hi, I am having a tough go in my marriage. We met when both of us were recovering from a breakup. My now husband was going through a divorce, and hindsight, he probably needed more time to “heal.” We moved in together after dating one year, and then married a year later. A few months before the wedding, I began to notice his irritability with me and his depression. We would fight and argue and never resolve. I felt that I couldn’t talk to him about anything, because he would get defensive and either not engage at all or get very angry. My husband has now started Zoloft (about 3 mos) and he sees a separate counselor. We went to a couple’s counselor for a year, and unfortunately, she thought it best to go to another therapist, being we weren’t getting anywhere and she thought we needed someone more “direct and a structured approach.” Last night, we started with another therapist who is focused on EFT. After the session, I brought something up at dinner, and my husband again got defensive and later angry. It’s easier to not “talk” to him at all. I am torn, being we have only been married for 7 months and the road seems very long. We are not getting our emotional, mental or physical needs met. Would you recommend a certain type of counselor?

I do go to therapy, but I think there’s something else wrong with me. I have overcome my eating disorder as well as my depression, suicidal thoughts, and my anxiety is much better, but something I thought was normal was just brought to my attention to my therapist. I hear voices. Nobody else hears them apparently. They’ve got names and I can tell which one’s talking. Pan and Jacen talk the most, but there’s Kiri and Winter and others. They are not me and they have distinct voices. Sometimes I feel like I’m being followed and this makes my heart race. Sometimes when I swing or walk on the sidewalk I feel like someone’s going to shoot me or fire an arrow into my back. It’s dumb, but I can’t help it. Sometimes I see strange things that aren’t there. I used to see a dragon in the downstairs bathroom as a kid and sometimes my vision goes white or static is in front of all of it.

"Hi, this has been bothering me for quite some time. I am looking to get some clarity about some major psychological symptoms I suffered from in the past which actually became alleviated on there own. Now in hindsight I’m wondering what happened. I am a 36yr old female. When I was between the ages of 11-19 my home life was incredibly tumultuous and stressful. Not surprisingly, I suffered from insomnia and from 16-19 began taking a fair amount of Melatonin to try and get my sleep cycle back in order – which didn’t work. All of my symptoms only came on at night – not when I was sleeping but the house was quiet and everyone else in bed. I would have auditory hallucinations of people talking in the attic above me or outside my window. Always just low enough so I couldn’t make out what they were saying but loud enough that I was absolutely positive someone was there. I was also incredibly paranoid about people breaking into my house (and thinking I would hear people breaking in) which would lead me to be up and down all night checking out sounds and checking doors to make sure they were locked. This went on almost every night for months at a time over several years. Eventually, I moved out, began to create healthy limits with my family and the symptoms subsided. Aside from a few episodes of sleep-walking, everything was pretty normal until I was about 27-29. I moved into a house with my not-yet husband and was unhappy at my job but the stress was nowhere near the level of my previous home life. Again, the symptoms resurfaced. I wasn’t sleeping. I was stay awake or sit up in bed for hours because I kept thinking I heard people breaking into the house. I was hearing noises and get up again and again all night checking things out, only to have no signs of anything amiss. Eventually, the symptoms subsided, I quit my job and haven’t had these symptoms since. Yes, I do have a history of mental illness in the family – Bi-polor disorder, schizo-affective disorder and major anxiety disorders. Can someone explain what may have been happening to me?

I also have contact with, well, what I call “aliens”, but they’re not really aliens, that’s just a word I use to describe them to other people. They’re more like divine interventions, sometimes their thoughts are in my head too. I believe they’re the ones who put me here on earth. The demons sometimes speak to me in my head or externally, but mostly I feel them or see them following me, they’re faceless. They’ll mock me if they do speak, or intimidate me through their presence. The divine interventionalists, they tell me positive things, that I’m more evolved than others.

"So for at least a year I’ve had many situations where I feel for instance that cameras are hidden all around my house and that people are watching and listening to me. While I feel like that I try to tell myself that that’s probably not happening (because I have looked and not found any cameras) but I still feel like it is. (I have thoughts like that at least once a day.) another example of what is happening is I have a feeling most of my friends are secretly trying to hurt me and my reputation when that doesn’t make sense. I have tried to confront my friends, they denied it but a part of me thinks if they actually are conspiring against me then that is exactly what they would say. Something else that might be related (I’m not sure) is that I don’t really speak to anyone at school after I confronted my friends (I used to speak to people) I am just not very interested in talking to people who are out to get me.

However, when I try to explain depression to him to make him understand depression from my angle, my father refuses to understand.

" I am a 20 year old female with schizophrenia. I am worried about my sexual fantasies, and worried that if I start stressing about them too much it might just trigger another psychotic episode, so even though this is not a pleasant subject I really need to talk about it with someone, but since I don’t feel comfortable talking about this with anyone, I figured I could write about it here. So here goes. Basically, my sexual fantasies (or dreams) are pretty much always about raping or molesting women. I don’t know why. Also, in these dreams or fantasies, it can even be children, or even babies. I find this really disturbing. (There are other things I worry about, like am I transgender, or am I a lesbian, but obviously the first two things I mentioned worry me so much more.) What I want to know is, what’s wrong with me? Do you have any idea why I have these thoughts? Also, how can I change them? How can I have healthy sexual fantasies? Is there any therapy for this? I really wish I could talk about this with someone, maybe then these fantasies would go away. I guess the only good side to this is that because of my medication, I have very low libido, so these fantasies and dreams don’t come all that often. But I’m still very worried. Also this pattern of having sexual fantasies of non consensual sex has been going on for a long, long time for me, maybe ever since I was a child. Do you have any idea why this could be?

"My boyfriend and I have been “together” since August, but on and off since we broke up 3 times. He has these constant feelings of insecurity, self doubt, feeling the need to compete (he visited me after work and said he was better looking than any of the guys there, for example; and today he was upset that his best friend was poking me on Facebook, and it made my boyfriend insecure). He overthinks really bad, gets really stressed out and handles it the wrong way. Two weeks ago he got really stressed and asked if I wanted to break up. Of course not. He’s been cheated on and betrayed and he knows friends and family who have also been betrayed in the past, so I get that he will have trust issues, insecurity, maybe even a hint of jealousy (or a lot of it?), but I think he may need help. I’m not sure. I love him, and when he’s not being upset, we’re fine. But he gets upset a lot; today he said he wasn’t eating because he felt “down in the dumps”. That worries me because over a year ago he was dealing with something else, and stopped eating, and went to a mental hospital. He said that after taking antidepressants, he eventually felt better and he hasn’t dealt with that issue again. The issues in our relationship have to do with him; he always says it’s him, something he needs to deal with, etc. His insecurity, overthinking, self doubt, lack of confidence or trust in anyway, the way he views the world so negatively and always expects the worst possible outcome, etc. Today he said he wants a break. I highly doubt a week-long break will cure this; I don’t want to insult him, but I’m not sure how to say that I think this is something he probably needs to speak to a professional about, and not deal with on his own.

I love my house, its ours and the thought of someone else living here and making it their home just makes me burst into tears.Another recent example was I had my first brief relationship which I ended just before we got together because I just couldn’t deal with it. He asked me out and I cried the whole walk home after saying yes,I did the same thing(crying)after he kissed me in the car ride home with my dad. My parents keep telling me to stop getting so worked up about silly things but I just cant help it.","A weirder example is when I got a second cat, I kept trying to convince my parents to give her away because I liked the dynamic of having one cat,it meant no favourites and the thought of things changing made me cry just thinking about it.",Magnification,
"Hi! I’m 22 years old and for the past year and a half of my life I have been in a never ending cycle of self-loathing. I think firstly it is important to understand that I’m not the type of person to ask for help. I rarely do even at the most minimal of levels. So it goes without saying that this is, in a way slightly uncomfortable for me. That being said let me address the issue at hand. For the last year and a half I have been experiencing feelings that confuse me. Feelings that until now I have yet to express to any other person, including close friends and relatives. My issue is this, every single and I mean every single thing that I do that is not done to perfection I beat myself up about. I’m not talking about when it happens but in the future. I’ll be watching TV, driving a car, walking down the street and Bam! Out of nowhere a negative thought, embarrassing moment, or otherwise distasteful event will pop in my head. For the next 30 seconds to a minute it will consume me from the inside out. At best I’ll clench my fist or jaw and maybe shake my head. At worst I’ll have to lay down and take deep breaths to overcome it. Whether the event was a lie I told years ago or an awkward encounter I had with a close friend that if I asked they may not even remember. It’s a constant war in my head. On one hand I can realize that 99% of these past events just don’t matter in the bigger picture of life but on the other i’m a perfectionist and they are just unacceptable things that drive me insane. This has lead to strong anxiety to the point that If I’m having a episode in my head I may slur my words while I’m talking to someone. Furthermore it has lead to a hatred for myself and a deep sadness. I have been loved by so many people and can’t explain why I feel the way I do. But the churning in my stomach has to go. It is just to unbearable. Thank you very much for your time.","My issue is this, every single and I mean every single thing that I do that is not done to perfection I beat myself up about.

My question is, more or less, is it considered within the norm for ones go-to response when faced with a dangerous situation to be sexual offering? I Can’t put this in to context using personal experience really….it’s more of an instinctual thing? if that makes sense? I’ve never acted on it as I have never personally been in a situation that would illicit that response, but when I’m watching or reading anything scary or thrilling, I always find myself chanting; “Seduce the antagonist” in the back of my mind and honestly believe that if i were in a situation similar to the one’s I’m watching/reading, that My response would be the same.

"So I’ve had a rough time recently and I have depression and anxiety issues. I went over to a friends house last night and we were just talking in her room. Then we moved out into a little tree-pod thingy. (I don’t really know how to explain it better than that sorry.) After awhile we were talking about the way we were imagining a creature that had the head of a guy from the Russian Sleep Experiment and the body of the creepypasta ‘The Rake’. After that we really started to get freaked out. We closed our eyes so we didn’t look out the windows anymore, and we started to imagine it staring at us. I could almost feel it watching me. We both stopped talking and it continued to stare at me, but eventually it was just gone and I was in my idea of a ‘perfect room’. Someone was sewing my mouth shut, and I could feel the pain in my lips. I kept breaking the thread it was using but it just kept sewing it layer by layer by layer. Finally I couldn’t talk anymore, I couldn’t breathe. My hands felt numb and my arms were shaking. Awhile later I was conscious of my surroundings again and I could feel my mouth, I couldn’t move it open. I ran my hands over it and the thread was gone, and my lips were unharmed. I could still feel the pain and a tingling sensation in my ribs. My friend said she experienced something similar to this. (We both have depression and anxiety problems). We don’t know what to do, it felt so real and we had another one after it. Has anyone had something similar happen? I imagined myself into a panic attack?",,No Distortion,
"I’m still young, since I’m only 19. My parents are divorced, and I live with my mom. I can talk to my dad whenever I want, but his wife (my step-mom) is very controlling an makes me want to avoid him. My grandfather was a child molester, though I don’t remember him ever molesting me. I DO remember him taking pictures of me naked, but nothing else. It didn’t seem to be very traumatic at all though. However I still have a sexual desire for boys around the age of 12 or 13 or so. A therapist I talked to (it wasn’t a full blown weekly thing,..I just talked to her three times, and that was it.) said that something happened at that age that stunted my sexual development, and now I am stuck at that age sexually. I agree with her conclusion because it would explain all my feelings such as my feeling that my body hair is unnatural and that it makes me feel dirty, and that people the same age as my body are intimidating to make friends with. 13 yr olds are much easier to make friends with for me as well. I have no idea what it was. Luckily I also have another paraphilia, which is called partialism (fetishism).",,No Distortion,

However, i don’t know why i do them, i know it’s the right thing to do and it is important for health etc but i don’t really care about it all. I never have truly “wanted” anything ever. Never had a burning desire or loved anything. I have always had issues with emotional attachment and lack any form of emotional connection with any thing.

"I have been a stay at home mom for 11 years. My boys are now 12yrs old and 8 years old. I stayed home with them due to their health issues. But they are now healthy thriving smart boys.

I got this job to feel like I contribute to the household. Feel important, valued. To feel respected. To feel proud of myself. To feel like my husband is proud of me.All that has developed from this is all the opposite.I have tired to tell him how I feel. He always turns the conversation about him.

"My girlfriend and I grew into a relationship that is very valued. I found us important and I believe she does as well. We both realized we had past relationships, but she mentioned that she had one that was a friends with benefits relationship. His name came up a few times. I found that she used to work with this guy and they remained friends. Up until right about here, I was not thinking much of anything about it. When I mentioned something about a “named guy” having a past with her and they still being friends, she replied “yeah, and I STILL friends with him…” (maybe red flag?). Anyways as time went on, there were get togethers at first with out me…then I asked if I could come to one where he’d be there. I went, and I really just got an entirely bad vibe. Long drawn out hugs followed by “I miss yous…”. I tried my best to voice my discomfort with the situation, but she was very defensive and dismissive, saying I have nothing to worry about and that it was just sex…(more than a few times). Needless to say, it has not been resolved. I feel resentful now of the entire scenario and worse, it seems like this guy just keep “showing up” places where either we or just her and her friends go. I’m losing patients, I don’t want to control her or somehow erase her past. I would like her to understand that I am uncomfortable with the whole thing and it has taken a life of its own in my head now. I can always break up with her to avoid feeling this way, but I love her. I just don’t feel like she cares. The only reason I can think of her dismissing it is because she is ok with it, there is no reason I shouldn’t be. I’m not sure she realizes that being defensive and dismissive makes it seem like there is something going on, or that she is saving. I try to stay calm, but I get very upset about it sometimes.

Over time, her mental health has been getting worse. She has been on less benders in this time, however she is never happy. She is constantly stressed- even though there is no stress to worry about.

" From a man in the UK: As long as I can remember, I’ve had an issue where if I am holding a partner for more than 5-10 minutes, I get really physically tense. It builds in intensity, to the point where I just have to break away into my own space for a while. It can happen sat on the sofa, or when going to sleep. I don’t feel emotionally distressed, just a build of muscular tension where I really need to tense muscles as the tension builds to unbearable levels. It does feel like I need to escape/run, but I’m not at all emotionally panicked, it’s just a physical response to something. It’s rather like a purely physical portion of a fight/flight response.","It builds in intensity, to the point where I just have to break away into my own space for a while.",Magnification,
"I am so out of touch with reality I don’t know what to do anymore. There have been times where I believed I had some sort of ability, fantasized about killing people and willingly ‘chose’ insanity (which is insane). I’m mentally confused and have terrible memory. I spend, at times, 90% of my waking hours in mental fantasies that are too often disgusting. I talk to myself 100% of the time I’m alone, like I’m a different person. I don’t have a split personality, but at one(more than one) point I tried forcing myself into having one. I think it’s some sort of emotional disorder that started this behavior, maybe out of a feeling of emptiness or left out and this being my way of feeling special, or possibly rebelling against a world that left me feeling alienated. A lot of these insecurities are gone now but my habits have gone too far, and it’s driving me crazy. I don’t see an end to it, and it’s messing with my ordinary thoughts and the way I think them. The bad memory was from a carbon monoxide leak in the room across from mine(for the years I had these habits). Could they be the source of all this? I have negative sexual habits toward amount of masturbation and what I do it to. I’ve worked a lot on this and gotten into what I would call a ‘normal’ routine but there’s always the thought. It’s just another terrible behavior I forced myself into for no reason. I have this imaginary meter in my head, and when I move in a certain way I automatically counterbalance it until it ‘fits’. I’ll also second guess a lot of my thoughts, and then second guess that and so on until my head hurts. It’s like I split myself into two angles when I’m talking to myself, or deciding to do certain things, but I’m still controlling both sides, and I know in the back of my head how stupid it is, but it’s so ingrained in me that I can’t stop it.

"I am a 25 year old woman and I feel very confused. For some time now, I have experiencing lesbian tendencies. I feel that I am “straight” and have a history of dating men. However, I have always had a problem with having an orgasm while having sex with a man and usually have to do it on my own, even during sex with a man. I find myself to be attracted to women, particularly those I see on TV. I even find myself searching for lesbians on web sites and I find I get extremely aroused when I come across lesbian pornography. I have talked to a girlfriend of mine who has the same feelings (she is also straight), even further than me. She does not believe that this means that we are lesbians and assures me that every girlfriend she has feels the same way about this attraction to women / lesbian pornography. I even fantasize about women when I am trying to get an orgasm with a man. I know I am attracted to men and I am not attracted to the everyday women I see and talk to everyday, only those “fantasy” type of women I see on TV and on pornographic websites.

"My husband and I are presently living with my mother in her house for the last 10 yrs. I have a brother that moved in with us 2.5 yrs ago. Years ago he had some sort of breakdown and moved in with my parents and stayed for 4 yrs. I found some odd things on his computers. He was on some sort of online site with animals portrayed as humans. A curvy woman’s body with a sexy fox female face. I also found a small lion cub (Simba) stuffed animal with a small circular hole under the tail that was hot glued around the circle so that one could see the stuffing inside. I am guessing he was using it as a sex toy. I told my mother she asked me to call the psychiatrist he was seeing. I did he told me to get him out of the house immediately. I told my mother and she had him leave. He was laid off 2.5 yrs ago I found evidence of the same sort of behavior. This time it was a small black panther with the same odd hole under the tail and glued around, also his screensaver had a picture of a sexy woman with a fox face. I see little foxes scattered around the room he stays in. Guessing it’s his female animal of choice. I never said anything to my mother she’s been ill so I kept quiet. Lately he and I don’t get along. We (husband and I) don’t trust him. We lock our doors even if we are only outside feeding the dogs. He always lies and has already stole from us but denies it. My mother says she can’t survive without him. Rather than looking for he decided to stay here and care for our mother. She could do more for herself but he waits on her hand and foot.

"It took me a very long time to find a man with the intelligence, kindness, energy, talent, competence and intellectual confidence that I wanted. He is perfect in all ways but sexual, I know he loves me. He proves it every day in countless ways.For many years now, I have totally buried my sexuality. I have, in fact, denied myself and not let myself be who I am. I have felt bad for being so sexual. I would try to initiate and/or discuss sex but has left him feeling pressured, demeaned and somehow the need to feel that he needed to be changed. Now, he is stuck in his own self-awareness of all that he feels he is not. To other women he was something. To me… I thought he was something else, that’s all. As a result, we’ve been terribly unhappy. I feel I have been in the hellish grip of a major depression. This life we have created is untenable for both of us. He cannot give me the sex I want. I don’t know what he can give me anymore. I don’t yet know how much more I can do without. We have worked out so many things, our communication can’t be any stronger and yet continually fails us.

"I am reaching out to you as a desperate man, in a need for diagnosis and advice. My health insurance is shit and I still live with my parents who don’t really believe in mental illness and think that I simply have to focus on other things and that it will pass. I don’t have time. I don’t have the strength. I’m supposed to be graduating the next year. My family depends on me. This has to end. Please, help me. Help me now. I am a Caucasian man, eighteen. Never been diagnosed with a mental disorder. However, I would scare quite easily as a kid. Once, I even developed a brief fever due to stress. I also developed symptoms that I would later recognize as OCD and scrupulosity at the age of nine. It calmed down in my teen years. I was also bullied for a few years, but after moving to High school and fitting in I let that go. It all started out on November 14th this year. I swallowed a fishbone, and felt it stuck in my throat. I was really stressed out, I thought I was going to suffocate. I ate a lot of bread and drank a lot of water, but I never really felt it go down. I calmed down by the evening, and I slept quite well. The next morning, I watched a horror movie, then an episode of “Cold Case”. It didn’t really scare me or anything, but I felt… weird. Like I couldn’t concentrate. And, sometimes, I would feel dizzy. Like I was going to faint. But it calmed down by the afternoon. I had a big dinner and drank a lot of water. I woke up quite early the next morning, with a nausea. I could barely eat. I was on the verge of vomiting the whole time. I kept googling my symptoms, fearing that I have a stomach ulcer, or even an internal bleeding. I calmed down by the evening, but I woke up at around one am, feeling cold and legs trembling. I didn’t go to school on Monday, figured it was some sort of viral infection. But that night, I couldn’t sleep again. I did go to school, but at around three pm, I would feel like I was on the verge of fainting. Like a barely controlled panic attack. But then I would calm down. On Wednesday night, I fell asleep. But in the morning, nausea. I spent the whole day stressing over that. Since the symptoms didn’t pass, I got into my head, despite not being overly religious, that I must be demon posessed. That would really freak me out. I would calm down eventually, and realize how absurd those thoughts were, but when they would plague me, there was no room for reason. I barely had any apetite by that point. I gave my blood and urine up for testing. It all came back clean. The next week, my apetite has returned. But, at night, I would have horrible, violent nightmares. I would actually feel physical pain, despite sustaining no actual injuries, and wake up at around one or two am. I researched about a movie called “Jacob’s Ladder”, that reminded me of my situation. I watched a few clips and read a plot synopsis. It only freaked me out more. For the next few days, everything would remind me of violence and horror images. Nightmares continued. Then I came to think of one movie (not a horror movie) that freaked me out as a child, but I eventually got over it. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I watched a few clips on YouTube and it freaked me out even more. Now every day I have that scene in my mind, feel like I was when I was a child, with that irrational gut feeling that I will see that being from the movie when I open the door, look into the mirror, etc. Even before that, I was afraid of reverting back to a child-like state, becoming a failure, etc. Anyway, right now, it’s like my body is wired. In the morning, I feel terrible, and only calm down by around five or six pm. I have that weird feeling, like I am a child again (back when everything was big and scary and I didn’t really understand how the world works), constantly stressing over the things I know are not rational. I can’t make positive associations anymore and I can barely study. Like my mind is, for no reason, afraid of those memories, so it keeps freezing up, and when it doesn’t, those stupid thoughts keep interrupting me. It is like a combination of anxiety, OCD, and the world’s creepiest deja vu. It’s like my mind is constantly on alert, and worrying about intrusive thoughts. I actually have headaches because of stress. I feel better when I dissect my fears and talk about them, and actually LABELING myself (anxiety, OCD), but soon after the thoughts return, and I feel terrible again. Then I think “what if there is no cure”, “what if I stay this way forever”, “why me”, or “what if there is some truth to this, since you are so afraid”, and I just hit rock bottom. To make matters worse, there’s been lots of exams lately and my family is going through some tense times. I can’t catch a break. I have tried: -meditating -masturbating -exercising -focusing on other things -eating candy -rationalizing my fears -drinking alcohol (not much) -writing about my issues -talking about my issues with my parents -drinking chamomile tea I don’t drink alchohol (except those two times), don’t smoke, don’t do drugs. Never suffered a concussion or a head trauma in my life. I recently took an online IQ test (I know those aren’t really reliable): it came back as between 105 and 120. I also only seem to have nightmares when I go to sleep late, but even when I don’t my dreams aren’t much better. I know that this isn’t a therapy session but I have told you everything I would have told you in person and my blood and urine results came back clean. Please, give me some advice. Any… “thinking techniques”? Possible medications? A combination of both? Do you think an MRI scan may be revealing?

"My best friend and I are very different from each other but we have grown a very strong relationship over the years. She is a smart, highly educated, 32 year old virgin that I hardly think has ever even kissed someone. Myself, I have been in many relationships but am currently single, 32 years old as well. My friend has been growing as a person a lot over the last year, and in August she came to me and said she´d started dating someone she met online. I was very supportive that she started online dating, and thrilled that she wanted to go out for drinks, buy shoes with high heals, and I encouraged more social behaviour. She dated this guy for a few weeks and it ended. Then, about 6 weeks ago she called me at 00.30 on a Thursday night, asking if she could come over because she had something to tell me. I got a bit stressed thinking it must be serious, because it was so late, and because it could not wait. She told me that when she started dating that online-guy they had sex. He was her first, and they were not in love. Then she told me that she liked it rough and he could not give her what she wanted. She had therefore joined a sadomasochistic sex society, went to an information meeting and now attends meetings and parties. This just after having sex for the first time a few weeks earlier. She told me she didn’t want to lie to me and wanted me to know what was going on, because we are so close and I know everything that is going on in her life. This particular night she came straight from a 45-year-old man she had had sex with. My friend and I have hardly ever talked about sex, I have even wondered that she might be a lesbian without knowing it herself yet. I was shocked to say the least. We live in a small city with 300 000 inhabitants, big enough to be anonymous, but still. I want her to experience love and sex, not sex as a mechanistic act. The days after her confession I felt confused and sad, kind of like I’m losing her. Now she has a complete new side to her life that I cant share with her, and she has met so many new people. People of all sorts with a variety of sex-interests, some living in polygamist relationships. A lot that is new to me, but I wish to be open-minded. One week after the breaking news she attended a party and met a guy wearing latex clothes. Lets call him Alan. They jumped straight into a relationship, and one week after they first met, Alan and his friend joined my friend and I at a cabin trip (because he was going to Kuala Lumpur in a few days for work). He was rude to me and I did not like his attitude. He seems very emotionally unstable (I have a PhD in neuroscience), and recently got out of a 6-year relationship, just 2 months prior. He kept talking about his ex and how she being mentally ill had ruined their relationship. Apparently this ex-girlfriend grew up in several foster homes and was sexually abused, married a 25-year-older man that she left – including the children because she was an unfit mother. Later on it was revealed that this old father had abused the children too, and she got the custody back. Then she met Alan. Alan is dominant and my best friend likes to be dominated, apparently. I cant help but think that Alan sort of “liked” being with a damaged woman that he could help and further dominate. I don’t know, but it bothers me how negatively he was talking about her. All matters have two sides. Now my friend talks about Alan constantly and is in love. She has already introduced him to her parents and some of our other friends. After only 5 weeks acquaintance. She really wants me to like him. However, I find it really hard to like him and her new lifestyle. I feel like I have lost her and that our friendship has changed forever. It makes me really sad, she has been such an important part of my life for so long. I feel like she has put a lot on me, the sex-club in itself will take some time to accept. However, introducing a man to me just a few days after the confession and expecting me to like him, is just too much. How should I react to this? I am trying to be happy for her, but in a way I don’t want to. It’s quite possible that if I don’t like this new guy I will lose my best friend. Should I just move on and accept that we have become too different now? I would really appreciate some thoughts about this, I have no-one I can discuss it with.

"For many years now my partner has insisted he needs to rest a lot. He rests for hours after coming home from work and spends all afternoon on the couch sleeping on the weekends. Yet he is not distressed by this and he doesn’t ask his doctor to fully investigate this or continue going back saying I’m still tired. And when he’s been offered referrals to suitable specialists refuses to go. Hence I’m wondering if this is a red flag in a relationship. In the past I’ve raised this issue asking him to get his fatigue fully investigated and to take up any referral offers advising of it’s impact on our relationship (limited activities together, no kids as I felt he wouldn’t cope with active kids plus being unfair on kids to be cooped up due to their father being too tired to be active with them) as well as saying it can’t be very pleasant for you to feel like this and wouldn’t it be better to feel less tired and have the energy to do things. I’ve also suggested sedentary activities but he’s not interested. He also doesn’t want to take any medication not even vitamins or trial antidepressants. It is hard on the partner as the partner starts off feeling sorry for the fatigued person and accommodates their need to rest to find several years down the track they’ve spent their life sitting on the couch rather than living life. And I’m thinking it’s just not normal to have this excessive need for rest yet not be distressed by this. I could understand more if he had health problems that couldn’t be treated but he tests as being very healthy and somehow has a high level of fitness.

"I fake all emotions and interactions, and I hate sex: I’ve been tossed around to several therapists and psychologists, because at an early age I loved to kill things; bugs, frogs, birds, etc. I don’t know what it is that’s caused me to be that way, but whatever. All I know is that whenever any random emotion has struck me, I’m quick to thinking about killing. It used to be wanting to kill small animals with my step-dad’s old hunting knife, but now it’s progressed to wanting to kill people. Nobody really in specific, unless there’s a person who has directly given me hell. Many people fake emotion every day, but I feel like I fake them all, except for anger. I want to use knives and sharp objects to sever a person’s aorta, and I want to watch the lights in their eyes go out; I don’t want it for the blood, I don’t want it for any reason other than to kill. I can’t explain it. The only thing close to this that I’ve been able to find in my studies is sociopathy or sadism. Neither of these seem to fit me though, because both conditions usually include having some kind of sexual need. Sociopaths typically excessively masturbate, whereas I never have. Sadists usually yearn for a masochistic sexual partner to torture and humiliate, whereas I’ve never wanted it. Sex has always been a thing that I find disgusting, messy, and unnecessary for recreation. I have a girlfriend who wants sex, and I’ve always just had to act like I want it too, but honestly, I’d rather be doing anything else than having sex. I seem to fit the profile of a sociopath because of the whole lacking empathy thing, but I don’t rejoice (nor mourn) in the act of manipulating people for any reason. I don’t want to know what’s wrong so that I can get help – I just don’t want to end up having to go to prison. I want to know how to control my urges before they control me. If that takes getting help, so be it, but if there’s any other way, I’d love to know. Thank you.",,No Distortion,

"Basically, I’ve come in search of help with anger management. I was raised with very strict, religious, over protective parents who constantly had violent arguments, taught me to shut down my emotions and to not express my feelings (at least not in healthy ways), taught me that the world is a dangerous, untrustworthy place, and that I cannot trust anyone. As a result, I have grown up to be very nervous, very shy, unable to trust others, unable to express love easily, unable to deal with negative thoughts or emotions in a productive fashion, afraid to be independent in the world, and constantly feel like I can’t make something successful of myself.

I want to do something, have fun, grow up , stop being so shy, and improve as a person, but, I don’t know where to start.

His problem is that he seems to completely believe that he can’t do anything and that he is on the way out. Anything that we do to help him he is convinced is killing him. He will do nothing for himself and needs to be strongly encouraged to the point of pushing to do anything. By anything I mean eating, drinking, getting up, washing, going to the toilet, standing-up Etc.

I pick at my chapped lips for hours at a time, as well as ripping open the skin around my fingernails, and picking off all scabs multiple times – I have very limited personal relationships with people and struggle to make friends – I had 2 childhood friends that I kept for a long time (one for 8 years, one for 10 years) the 8 year friendship ended recently and I really don’t feel like I miss her – When my family goes out of town for long periods of time I don’t really miss them but when they call I tell them I miss them because I feel rude if I say that I don’t – I hardly spend time with my friend (the 10 year friendship I mentioned) I see her maybe once every couple months – ' – I lie a lot and am extremely secretive",I feel as though if I cut everyone out of my life I wouldn’t really miss anyone,Fortune-telling,

"I have trouble controlling what I speak when im angry. My mother hurts me with her words and I hurt her right back. I really don’t mean to do that it just happens.

My wife says there is ‘no oxygen flowing to her brain’ and asks her father to violently shake her head while blaming me for what happened to her mother. She ‘regains consciousness’ after a few minutes. Opportunity to address problems lost. 5. Recently, she began exhibiting literal split personality. She went into a trance – some ‘god’ had entered her. She said my birth was flawed and that god has come here to save me, threatened my parents with curses and death and asked me to treat my wife well. She physically hits my wife when angry. 6. My wife is very similar – dual behavior – shows affection, romance, we live normally for a few days and then finds a random fault with a sudden mood swing and goes into a rage-crying-despair cycle. In her rage mode she is absolutely uncontrollable. She hits me physically, abuses me verbally, weeps and threatens to call the cops and book me for ‘dowry harassment’, degrades me in front of her mother, plays the victim and so on. 7.

"I’ve been happily single-by-choice for many years. Definitely not even considering ANY possibility of new “romantic” relationship. Out of NOWHERE, I started constantly thinking about & plotting ways to spend time with a man approx 15 yrs younger than I. He works evenings & nights as a security guard where I reside. He’s been working here for approx. 6 mos. I’d seen & even spoken briefly to him several times previously, but without a hint of warning I became “closer” (no physical exchanges due to my faith & beliefs). Here’s the kicker: he couldn’t be FURTHER from what has always been my “type”. Where I live there are many different nationalities & people from many diverse ethnic backgrounds. I’ve always been attracted first & foremost, by physical appearance & to races other than mine (Caucasian). This “young man” is Hispanic, having only arrived in Hawaii last year, and is pure WHITE, skinny, shaved head, big ears & a horrible physique. Now’s the time to add the fact of my extremely good, rare physical shape-not only for “my age” but for women in general. I’ve had 5 large babies but have always been very athletic-serious weight-lifting for many years as well as running, canoe-paddling etc. In 2009 I realized my 35-year dream & underwent an abdominoplasty which removed 2 lbs. of loose skin only-no liposuction needed-& complete abdominal muscle restoration (stretch marks & scars are history & I’ve had extensive tattooing over the surgical scars. People think I’m “fibbing” when they learn about my large family because my body definitely is not the “norm” in the many-children dept. I’m 5′ 2″, still somewhat muscular, have long, straight hair (in which I keep all traces of white from becoming obvious) & am feisty & energetic. I’m certainly not movie-star gorgeous but not too shabby for 61* So…what is up with my totally out-of-character attraction to this guy? He has a beautiful accent I call “Sprench” for Spanish/French because it sounds like a little of both.

" It started recently when I was finishing up my sophomore year of high school. I began to become increasingly paranoid (I thought people were out to get me, and that people kept staring at me, even if I was alone), that people could hear my thoughts, and I kept feeling like there was some sort of presence near me, and/or following me. Not only that, but I would have the occasional auditory hallucination. I didn’t hear voices, but rather noises people make such as breathing (as if someone were right next to me)r when I was alone (happened twice), a snarl (also as if someone were right next to me), and an exhale (right next to me; alone) , however these are minor compared to the visual hallucinations. These occurred in the corner of my eye. I would see moving shadows, full blown people (I would see them moving, sand they would be extremely detailed, but when I looked back they were never there in the first place.[this occurred 3 times]), and sometimes pictures would look like they were moving or finishing an action. Some of my other visual hallucinations I could see directly such as a face at the top of a door (occurred once), and one time I was sitting in drivers Ed and my teacher was talking about bugs when all of the sudden I see two black dots swarming around her head like flies, but it didn’t last long until they flew behind her head and disappeared. Another time I was sitting in a car and I saw a fly, fly right up to my face, so I swatted at it, but I realized that there wasn’t actually a fly, because I couldn’t find it anywhere, neither did I hear the buzzing of its wings. Another instance is when I thought I saw a bug crawling down my arm, but I didn’t feel it, nor did I see it where it should have ended up. Another time u thought I saw a bug crawling across my wall, but again I didn’t see it where it was suppose to end up (on the ceiling; it was crawling up). Not only that but when I walked down the hallways of my school, they would appear to be crooked, and moving, causing me to walk funny. Then there is other stuff like my loss of motivation, emotion (not flat effect), I would miss letters when I wrote, I began talking to my inner voice as if it were real (it talked to me first), I now have a bad attention span, and it’s now fairly hard to get my point across because I’ll get tongue tied, plus my personal hygiene is not the best, and my memory (especially short term) seems to be increasingly getting worse.

On one hand I see the world in a way that I would never be able to, but on the other hand it’s starting to drive me crazy. What makes it worse is I used to be able to do this thing where I could tell what people were thinking, but now I can’t do it. Instead when I look at people I get this horrible feeling that they’re thinking the worst of me. I have thought about taking my life but I always talk myself out of it because I wouldn’t want to hurt my family’s feelings or make them believe I didn’t care about them or they didn’t do a good job of being supportive for me.","What makes it worse is I used to be able to do this thing where I could tell what people were thinking, but now I can’t do it.

"It seems as if my Mom is always siding with my older brother, if he puts his feet up behind my head while I’m sitting on the couch, my mom tells me to move. She does this with all my siblings too, though. I have three younger siblings as well and no matter what they do she will defend them in every way, if one calls me a bad name, she will say they are going through something. Anyways, my brother is a year and a half older than me, he has had a few health problems in the past and my mother has really flocked to his side since then. (it’s obviously not his fault, I usually get along with him and I do love him.) He has recently started University which was really hard for my mom to deal with, he started the process last year and every step of the way she wanted to know how it was going with him and supported him whenever he was doubting himself. I have a lot of the same problems and struggles he went through, when I start to talk about University and how I’m stressed and worried about applying to my mom she just says “You’ll do fine.” Or “Don’t worry so much.” She doesn’t seem to really want to know how i’m doing or how i’m feeling. Whenever she gets mad about something, as well, I’m always the one she will scream at. I’ve gotten tired of it. If it’s not a big deal I’ll just take it, but sometimes I come home from school and I won’t be able to relax until I go to bed because she’ll start looking for fights and expects the most out of me. She treats me like a child and holds my siblings in favor (I feel), but expects me to act like an adult. If it’s a real problem I’ll stand up for myself and that’s when she’ll scream at me, my dad often gets involved because he knows I am not trying to pick fights with her, but I won’t take her disrespect if I have not done anything to deserve it. My siblings are never really yelled at. Anyways, sorry this is so long.

"My partner of many years had a childhood of abuse and abandonment. Eventually he was adopted and things improved to a degree. He’s never really dealt with his emotions about his past, although he is a sensitive guy and I know he has a lot of hurt inside him. He has instead chosen to repress and ignore these emotions. He moved across country, so his family is out of sight, out of mind. He will do anything to distract himself and not think about it. He definitely has shown signs of depression on and off over the years. I’ve suggested therapy to him before. It comes up perhaps once a year. He is extremely reluctant and he says has no desire to relive his terrible past. I’ve told him I understand that and that I think while therapy would be painful, I believe it would be worth it in the end. He’s extremely stubborn and pushing an issue will make him more likely to reject it, so I don’t bring this up often. My approach is to discuss it in a supportive manner, encourage help, not push it, leave it to germinate. It seems to have made him open up to the possibility of help. He has conceded in the past year that he might be depressed. We recently visited his adoptive parents. It had been 3-4 years since he had seen them, because they live back “home” and he’s been avoiding his past entirely. His foster father is very old and unwell. He put off seeing them as long as he could. I encouraged him to go visit, because the guilt at not going was evident and I knew he would have terrible regrets if his foster father died and he had not gone to see him in so long. I know he feels a lot of guilt for being so far from them, especially now they are old and unwell. He approached me today and stated he thinks he is depressed. I think this is a huge step for him to admit this. I want him to get the help he needs. I will of course, be supportive and will listen to anything he wants to talk about. I do strongly believe that therapy would be invaluable to him. How do I encourage this route without scaring him back into his shell?

"I’ve had chronic depression starting in childhood with an emotionally absent mother. I was recently diagnosed with PTSD/BPD by new therapist. Christmas marked the beginning of this debacle. which set up the disaster and now my BPD, etc is a Category 5 Tropical Storm. A CONTINENTAL DIVIDE now exists between my son and I has turned awakening my abandonment fears. His response is total silence (he refuses to investigate this new BPD thing) and has cut off any possibility to try to resolve this. Meanwhile ironically enough his abandonment of me over this is not imaginary. Left to my own devices I spend all my days since 1st of the year existing in a pattern of emotional turmoil I can’t take much longer. I alternate between feelings of inconsolable grief and abandonment into resentment and culminating in my anger exploding leaving horrible messages on his phone which increases the gap. If we had talked when this all began it would have never developed into the mega storm it is but now it has – he has made no effort to get insight into BPD – he has genuinely abandoned me. The anger eventually burns out leaving me numb then we start over again. Being ignored as though I don’t exist also fuels the flames. Suffice it to say that I don’t see a way out and I do not want to spend my life cycling between all these painful feelings. I want to be able to talk to him, acknowledge how a part of me knows the rage is wrong and help him understand the mechanics of BPD. But I cannot make him talk to me so he is never going to understand and I am doomed forever to the abandonment I feel. While he was supportive during 2 medial emergencies I experienced now I have to guess that because this alleged malady of mine is emotional he views it something i made up to to manipulate him.

"I’ve always been a pretty anxious person. But recently I started seeing things; shadows, faces, demons, and a lot of house cats that aren’t there when I go near them. I occasionally hear voices, mostly people yelling at me, but the hallucinations are more common. I’m so paranoid most of the time. I feel like I’m being watched or followed. I feel like there is someone outside of my bedroom door right now. I have a small TV in my room and I can see my refection in it from where I’m sitting. Something is telling me that’s not my reflection and it’s a supernatural creature watching me. I refuse to eat food that wasn’t made by myself because someone could’ve poisoned or spit in it. I tried to lay next to my mom earlier (she realized I was having an anxiety attack and wanted to hold me), and she had her arm around me. Something in my head, not a voice but a feeling, told me she was going to dig her nails into my back and rip out my heart. I got up and ran into my room without saying anything. Also, whenever I’m outside or in public, when I hear someone laughing or talking I feel like they are making fun of me. I don’t trust anything. I put paper over all cameras on my all my devices. I feel like the government is watching me. I thought I could have schizophrenia (my great-great grandma had it), but all the stories I read, people which schizophrenia seem to not be aware that something is wrong with them, although I am very aware something’s not right with me. Pretty much everyone in my family has anxiety and depression. My brother and cousin have struggled with anorexia and my mom is bipolar. Should I get help? My mom thinks I’m clairvoyant.

"Recently I feel like I have been acting odd and people are starting to notice. I randomly zone out and have visual hallucinations like tall silhouettes and people following me. There’s also a voice in my head that will whisper to me during the day, but becomes extremely more vocal at night. Sometimes they’ll tell me to do odd things like hide under a desk or confess my undying love or hate to a stranger. Sometimes it’s worse, they just whisper my name over and over, sometimes tell me to kill or hurt people that I wouldn’t want to. They also seem to control my thoughts and feelings, because sometimes they say I need help and I believe them. Other times they say I don’t and I believe them. They generally control how I feel about people. I’m also convinced that other people can read my thoughts, maybe not everyone, but definitely most people. Nobody else believes me and I really do want an answer.

"From a teen in the UK: Okay so I was bullied during primary school by kids younger then me which made it so embarrassing that I never told anyone. They used to make fun of my weight and that’s where I think my issues began but I never acted on them. When I went to secondary school at about 12, although I wasn’t being bullied anymore, I went on a diet.

"I think I may have DP. My world feels very surreal. I feel “detached” from my body. I want people to see me as my mind and not my body. It’s almost as if my body is a puppet and my mind is the puppet master. Everyone sees and love the puppet but no one truly knows the one controlling it. And my body feels “fake” to me, as if it’s not truly my own body. I hardly even can recognize myself in the mirror and will sometimes avoid mirrors for this reason. I will have moments where I’m dragged out of my surreal state. Some are random, some have a cause. The times that are random if feels as if I have been flying my whole life and for but a moment I touch my feet to the earth and feel trapped. The light seems new, the people I thought I new seem like strangers. I have kind of “hypersensitivity” to the world and all motions feel strange. The things I had just been doing feel like a distant memory. This happens randomly. Sometimes I can be forcefully dragged out of my surreal state, usually by comments about my body or actions. I feel like a stranger to myself with a sudden awareness that people only see my body and my actions but they don’t truly see me, they never can see who I really am. The things I do and say seem foreign to me when I get a moment to think about it. It’s like I don’t even truly know who I am. I’m known to think I have various disorders when I don’t really so this makes me hesitate to say I have DP, though unlike times when I thought I had something like schizoid and I’d create the symptoms after learning about it, I had the symptoms previous to knowing what DP was and in fact was how I found out about DP. I don’t fit every symptom but some I do match up with. The feelings are rather mild and are more of an afterthought most of the time.",,No Distortion,

I requested add., appt. from therapist since i had been in crisis. She had asked me if I wanted a referral. I was asking for an add., appointment. I wrote to her via email which I never do. expressed my feeling that it sounded as if she was again questioning if she wanted to work w me. I feel that what I wrote was true but also express anger (depression frustration w progress ) even thu I understand I feel I am Now faced with therapist uncertainty since as she put it unsure what works for me and if she is not meeting my needs will refer out. This I feel is more of her issue over what I wrote along with my break in sobriety . Today, she was late and if she was running late in the past she w tex me as a curisity. When she arrived 10min late having no apology. Then she indicated she had 10min to finish up her lunch. After 15min waved her hand to proceed to her office. In procession she was in in an small area hidden out of site were the copier was I saw her and she said go on in. She came in shortly afterward and stated she was going to make a copy of the emails i sent to her this took yet another 5min. while in session I discussed up dates and my feeling of over the past several days and my feeling of progress. She also advised me we would review the emails i sent. She told me in no uncertain terms she would not give me any additional time until we come to some idea on how to work together. she cut the session short after her being late and gave an extra 15min wait time prior to visit. the entire interview was 35mins . She was finished even giving a honest attempt to discuss matters opened her door for me to leave turned her back on me she indicated she has scheduled me for the month of Sept., yet I have paid to be within a journal group which last thru sept. As I began to leave her office she also turned around to leave. I allowed her to understand that I felt her distaste of me and her attitute toward me requesting her to drop such . she reminded me that the session was over went into bath with door open turned around again with the same look of distaste on her face, she then smerked as she closed the door. Unfinished business and I feel termination is going to happen not that there is anyone else who will treatment me that specializing in tramua treatment to the extent that she has been and continues to train in. I again mentioned as I did in email has we walked down the hall if you do not want to treat me just say so. She and I have had diff in past just about a year ago when I called a break she took it as a termination. Yet accepted me back 3months later only to advise me of referrals both of which have been cited for breeches and disaplined with the Off., of Pro dis. she is aware of it . I fully understand that i wish to heal and i also respect her abilities however I feel again she is in decision making to terminate me. She knows me and I feel and expressed to her that this isnt just about me she did acknowledge it. As last week it was apparent she needed affirmation from me that the anger work was useful. But I informed her that I wa not sure if I would be able to do this excercise safely fearful i would get more sucked in and not be able to get out therefore lashing out on others . she understood that I believe as she eluded to affirm my decision as wise mind. I also stated yes and self awareness. Not acknowledged. she feels insulted and so do I I can get over it but she has again seems uninterested to treat even thu further appts scheduled. I asked her to lose her attitute toward me and that last wks session i felt became about her since she was not able to accept my affirmation of the theraptic session. I have been deeply depressed anger is real. I want to heal yet I do not have the reason to believe that she is willing. Now I want for next week to awaiting any if any discussion of our relationship which she has allowed me full understanding until we come to an agreement on what and how we work together are in place. I lack faith that she will to be resonable and I pushed her buttons apparently today. ended the session after 35min. What is ure thoughts. I feel her lack of desire to fully engage in any discussion. The facts of her rudeness toward me and yes I responded in rudeness and I regret it. She was willing to make a referal last week which confused me since I just wanted an additional appt.

"I am a co-facilitator (pro bono, unlicensed) for a men’s DV group (court-mandated) at a non-profit. The leader is a therapist who also has a private practice. In group one of the men mentioned fear of losing his probation for something he didn’t do and being imprisoned for years at an upcoming hearing. He didn’t return to the group after the hearing. She discovered he indeed had been jailed with another hearing soon to determine whether he will be imprisoned. He’s made enormous progress, despite a terrible childhood and adverse family dynamics, he has a good heart and reaches out to other group members, attends a drug-tested substance abusers group three times a week, and has focused on becoming a father again to his children (they were not the recipients of his abuse). But he’s also expressed suicidal thoughts in the past in the context of never wanting to go back to prison, and he’s become worn out and depressed in dealing with The System (frequent court hearings, probation officers, in-laws, etc. – you can imagine), and we’re deeply concerned about his mental health. He’s received no visitors. LA County is under a DOJ consent agreement to improve its mental health resources, but there have been numerous suicides nonetheless. The therapist is considering visiting the client in jail to check on his health and give him moral support, to let him know someone cares. But she and the non-profit center are conflicted about ethics and boundaries and dual relationships – she says this issue was never discussed in school or workshops, and the non-profit doesn’t even have a policy because this issue has never arisen before. I think it’s because the people setting boundaries aren’t the kind of people who go to jail very often. A large proportion of the country’s 2 million prisoners have some degree of mental illness and get almost no care. He hasn’t called — he’s expressed a sense of unworthiness that might keep him from calling. I don’t think this is the usual ethics and boundaries issue, and I think in these circumstances the benefit for man’s mental health and maybe even his life far outweighs the boundary risk.

"My mother has lived with me for years since she is regularly unemployed. Whenever I moved during the last 16 years, she usually followed. In the last 4 years, she has become paranoid–someone is stealing electricity, wifi, cable, cell phone service, water. We didn’t even have wifi or cable at the time. I even checked the water and electric usage, but found they were consistent with usage at other addresses. Then she decided someone must be at home at all times because someone is sneaking into the apartment–to mistreat our pets, to fiddle with the electricity, to steal services, to live in the attic. She also claims someone had wired the apartment to listen to us, wired the front door so it would randomly open, stole our forks (I don’t know where they went), stole the Mummy dvd (we have at least 100 dvds, but that one was the only one taken, sneaks through the ventilation, stops by and electrocutes her around 3 a.m. on random mornings, and added wires under the driver side of my car (don’t worry she pulled out). Someone disrupts the signal on her analog radio, she insists all power, circuit breakers be off, and the major appliances unplugged except for the refrigerator and a few lamps. She says her last 5 cell phones were hacked and taken over by someone. I have never experienced or witnessed any of the problems she claims. So she accuses me of helping the someone because I say none of these issues can be proven. She won’t see a doctor, and she can pass any mental test. Honestly, I wander if she is a dick rather than sick. These incidents have been continual at 3 dif ferent addresses. In the one address, the landlord said she could not live there any more because she was entering the basement and changing the handyman’s repairs. (I don’t know if this accusation is true; she denies it.) At one point nearly 2 years ago, I expressly asked her not to destroy the landlord’s county letter because it itemized repairs to the house. She ignored my request and ripped up the documents. I gave her $4000 (my savings) and my car and kicked her out of my apartment two years ago, so she stayed with my aunt for a week, in hotels for about a month. Then she came back for another $2000 (payday loans). Eventually, she spoke with the VA hospital, received a bed at a homeless shelter, and money to return to school. They also offered to pay for housing, but she couldn’t find a place she was comfortable with for the money offered. After a few months in the shelter, she “couldn’t” make it to the shelter by curfew, so she was kicked out and moved in with me again. Within a year, we moved again. About 8 months ago, we were evicted from a house (only 5 months into a year lease) because “someone” had cut out all the copper connecter in the electrical outlets (a fire hazard), had cut a large outdoor cord connecting the central air to the house, and had removed insulation and created holes in the outer walls. I cannot prove it was my mom, but no one else was in the house. She or I am always home. Now we’re in an apartment and she opens the outlets and has cut the connectors to the phone jacks. She still experiences are all of the aforementioned issues. I discovered she had pulled wires beneath the driver’s seat of my 8 month old car. She claims someone is hacking into its system. I plan to move because of unrelated issues, but because of my mom, I am hesitating. I am sick of the problems. I am sick of her refusing to listen to reason. I told her 5 months ago that I wanted to go separate ways with this move. I tried to give her time to find an apartment, get a job, request government assistance (she hasn’t worked since 2010), but she has proven she unwilling to take care of herself.

I help each and one of them on their weddings and spent at least £2000 in each wedding. I am now getting married [redacted] of August and I just realized that my dad is not coming, my sister is not coming, my brother is not coming and my second brother said he is coming and does not want to help in the wedding at all. My best man who I have known for 15 years has just told me he can’t come to my wedding because of his job even though I have been telling him to book his holiday from one year and he has been slacking off and maybe doesn’t want to come in person. All I have coming is my mum and sister. I don’t have a lot of friends. I cannot believe this is happening to me. I don’t know why is this happening. After each wedding, I get exhausted because I keep doing chores for 2 weeks for each of my family members and now when my turn comes, they keep giving me these stupid excuses.

"This is a long story so I apologize, but I really need some answers. My brother has been excited to go to Lollapalooza all year. He was finally going to go this past Tuesday. Well we got a call from him after only a day of him being there saying he wanted to come home. He was ballistically crying on the phone and saying he “felt the power of the antichrist.” I decided to drive to Chicago with my parents to get him. When we arrived, he was sitting on a bench without his bags. My dad asked him why he didn’t have his stuff and he said he gave it all away to his friends (it was all his clothing and his wallet.) He also said he threw his phone in the river because it was giving him fear. He then launched into a story about how secret servicemen were hunting him down because of his belief in God. The rest of the night, he continued talking about how God was giving him all these “tests” and how he felt like he was in a scavenger hunt. The next day his behavior got worse. He got up very early and started singing loudly (very unusual for him) then started walking around the city with no shirt, no shoes, and a guitar.",,No Distortion,

I now realize I lost 15 years trying and hoping for something that I had no evidence would make any difference anyway. That too, something of an epiphany further adding to my current state. That is one where I now feel no purpose or have any desire to do anything with life and feel it not too far away where it becomes unmanageable and I will commit suicide, albeit not wanting it.

"My older brother was diagnosed with schizophrenia 10 years ago. Before his psychotic break, we were close. After he got sick, I moved away for college and never moved back to my home state. For almost a decade, he’d only communicate with me in person. He was afraid to use email or the telephone because he thought people were spying on him. We I did talk to him, depending on what meds he was taking, he might be talkative or might not speak at all. He’s not really in treatment. He sees a psychiatrist every 2 or 3 months and takes a long term injection. That’s all. Other than that he never leaves the house. Technically he’s been medicated for 10 years, never off antipsychotics, but his delusions are always a problem. He still believes that certain people have betrayed him and tried to ruin his life. So I can’t say he was ever recovered or stable. His psychiatrist is aware of his ongoing delusions. In the beginning I encouraged my parents to get him to see a psychologist or other therapist and work out a treatment plan. They said, “He doesn’t want to do that.” So it never happened. Now I’m not close with my brother. He’s missed much of what happened in my life over 10 years, including my wedding because he didn’t want to go out of the house. My parents are trying to get us talking more. They use group text or Facetime. At first it was strained, and a year later I feel like I just don’t like the guy anymore. I don’t like the way my brother acts now. He’s rude, pushy, arrogant. He’s always criticizing and belittling me. He tries to manipulate me into buying things for him online. He starts fights about politics that seem endless and he won’t ever let them go (and we all have the same politics, we’re all registered democrats, so I don’t even know how we manage to fight). He never asks me about my life, job, husband, hobbies, house, town, etc. When I talk to him about my life he changes the subject. He only likes to talk about his interests (movies, politics, music). If I talk to a friend I haven’t seen in 10 years, we catch up. My brother’s not interested in that. It feels really one-sided. There’s no give and take the relationship. I currently have health problems and my physician asked me to avoid stress. I just feel like it’s impossible to do that with his toxic tantrums once a week. But I don’t know how to tell my parents to just leave it alone, let us grow apart, we have nothing in common and just shouldn’t be talking.

"From England: Okay so ever since I was very young I’ve had a problem with zoning out. When I was about 4 my parents became very worried, I zoned out in the middle of conversations and I could be walking from one room to another and end up walking into a door or wall because of it. I have two older siblings and neither of them ever did this so my mum was ready to bring me to the doctors but my dad thought it was just my age as well as an over active imagination. My older sister has aspergers syndrome so my mum feared the worst but when I was older (around 6-7) I got checked for this and like my other older sister, I was fine. I still did well in school, it never really affected that but I did zone out in class occasionally. It never went away but was less frequent after around 10 years old however now I am 15 and for at least 6 months now it seems to have been becoming more and more frequent. I’m zoning out more and more and when I finally snap back into reality I’m not even sure how much time has passed, its kind of like being in a trance. Its not like it only happens when I’m bored, I can be doing something I really enjoy and then I just zone out. I’m also developing a strange liking for a little bubble I’m starting to create, which is totally separate from the zoning out as I actually feel conscious during it. I just go into a kind of ‘bubble’ and begin imagining different things, I find this really comforting but I’m concerned about how much I’m enjoying it, I could do it for hours on end and it feels so much better then real life. I’m more concerned about the zoning out more though as I’m not actively imagining or thinking during it, I’m just kind of not there and I cant stop it happening, it just happens whenever.

"I’m sure it’s strange to see a 15 year old on this website. As of right now, I am questioning if I should seek a professional to see if I may have illness. The trauma may have not been physical, but it hurt nonetheless. About a year and a half ago I had some trouble with my 2 “friends”. One was notorious for talking about me behind my back and the other would bend me to her will and ignore my demands (in a way I was trapped in the friendship.) After a while I had the 2 meet each other. That is when it went down hill. Within a month they began to ignore me, and this hurt, as they where both close friends. I would outcry to be included once more, and they would put me down. I felt invalid and unloved, and one day, I came to realize this was true. I asked one how they truly felt about me, all these years… only to be told that I was annoying and was given a rude remark on the relationships I’ve been in. I went crazy, and I now notice this was a panic attack. Then another bombshell; the other friend began to ignore me, and when I asked the other friend if they where ignoring them as well, they said yes. Only an hour later did I send the friend a message while the other was streaming, only to see ” __ messaged me again..”. I felt my heart crush under unbearable weight, and it is burned in my mind. after 2 months, I quietly cut ties with one, and after overcoming my fears, cut ties with the other. At that time, I had a 3 hour long panic attack. 2 months later I found myself in an abusive relationship. They intervened once more, teaming up on me on my social media, their intent to kill me. During these events as a whole, I practiced self harm and had suicidal thoughts. I thought it was all my fault, even if I’d been told it wasn’t. I would like to know if this may have caused PTSD. I am still having flashbacks and panic attacks, as well as hypersensitivity. The symptoms are getting worse. I feel the sting every day. I’ve seen symptoms of it online and I match all of them, it’s scary. (age 15, from US)","I felt invalid and unloved, and one day, I came to realize this was true.

"I have come a long way since 2008 when I had a complete mental health breakdown. I have finally gotten control over my action. I am winning my daily battle more almost all the time, or I was. I lost everything in 2008 including the ability to control my actions, for years my emotions ran everything. I didn’t want to hurt anyone. I hate taking medication but I was begging for anything that might help, only to be told I would be on so many pills I wouldn’t know whether I was coming or going.

"At first I divided them into two categories, the sedating ones that left me a zombie and the agitating ones that made me aggressive and gave my violent thoughts. I think I’ve been on 10-12 of them, including all of the standards. In trying the zoloft for a month I noticed that it started sedating but evolved into aggression, so the two categories might just be one with different timing.

"My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year now, we usually communicate our feelings and are very respectful of each other.

He knew he was supposed to be honest and never lie again, but he did it again about two weeks ago. He told me he was texting a friend of mine about their common interest in music and I was okay and happy he was honest. I hung up with him around 2am and told him to sleep soon because we had a date planned for early the next morning. I hung out with that friend a couple days later and she told me that they had stayed up until 4am texting and that he told her not to tell me. I confronted him, he admitted and said he was planning on telling me that night. He had once again deleted their conversation and I had to get it from her, btw she didn’t send me the important parts so I am no longer friends with her.

"My name is S—-, and I’m 19 years old. For most of my life, I’ve been experiencing urges to kill people. And not with guns or anything like that either. I want to slice them open with a knife, taste their raw flesh, and watch the light leave their eyes as they die. If people on the street knew what I was thinking about doing to them, then they’d probably be horrified. Fantasizing about this sort of of thing really arouses me sexually, and while it’s not the only thing that does, it’s possibly the best. These urges don’t only occur when I’m upset or angered, but those emotions definitely amplify them. For example, if I’m just standing there with something sharp in my hand, I’ll have the impulse to just thrust it into the soft throat of the nearest person. I would just love to feel it sink in, and get covered by the blood gushing from their wound. I’d probably cannibalize their body, too, because I love the smell and taste of blood. When I was younger, I would cut my arms just to taste the blood and rub it on my face. I’ve never actually killed anyone, no matter how much I’ve wanted to, but I a did stab my neighbor’s dog to death once. It just made me feel so alive, like nothing else ever had, to feel it’s fear and watch it die. Now that I’m writing this all down, it’s making me sound like some kind of deformed, basement-dwelling freak. But I’m an attractive person, have a sizable amount of friends, loving parents, and a beautiful girlfriend. She’s the real reason I’m writing this; I’m absolutely horrified by the prospect of her finding out what I’m like. I don’t want her to be afraid of me, but she’s too sweet to not be. I haven’t “gotten help” yet because I’m still living off of my parents, and I haven’t even told them I’m a lesbian yet, much less a psychotic cannibal. I just can’t see that conversation going well. I’ve also often fantasized about stabbing a therapist in the eye with his own pen, so I don’t know if that would be such a good idea. I don’t really want to have these thoughts and feelings, but my life wouldn’t be so fulfilling without them.

"Hello! Since i was a kid i always had problems of making friends. I travelled a lot, went to summer camps in Europe, prestige ones, graduated a good university(bachelor degree). But i always had the same problem: at some point i was becoming a person no one paid interest to or even tried to ignore me. Sometimes it even turn to fights… When i turned 18 i have found a couple of very good friends and we were drinking every weekend. didnt pay attention to health issues and many times (about 10) drank till blacking out… couldnt control myself and felt completely happy while being drunk. I also was smoking marihuana for about half a year. Ive never had a girlfriend(not because i am an unattractive, but my behavior) . The second problem i face–i cant concentrate at all. Since i was very young i have lost like 10 cell phones, credit cards, wallets, driver license, laptops. And i really hate myself for this. I tried many different sports(triathlon, half-marathon, boxing) for building precision, watched 100-s of TED talks, took some courses in coursera but seems like it getting worse and worse. Friends and family call me lazy,moony etc. While studying i distract every 5-7 minutes. To enter this question i spend like 3 hours. But sometimes feel very energetic, enthusiastic for a couple minutes. I jump, shout and feel like a champion. And i cant really predict this or control. Especially when i listen to the music. I stopped drinking alcohol for 3 month and do not plan to continue. I believed that i can start a new life and become a normal concentrated person within 3 month of writing down all my activities in my diary and analyze it weekly. To sum up 4 hours a day on average i spend in a “focused mode”. But after 1 week of having a rest i returned to the previous version of mine. During these 3 month i cried a lot, punched myself in a face, tried to die while doing sports. Time goes faster and my mental power is reducing. I forget things more often and sleep more.

I never physically attack another person, but I’ll start hitting my own head–hard, repeatedly, with both hands–sometimes open hands, sometimes fists.

"From Germany: I am 21 years old and currently in my third year of studies. Last semester, I was having a hard time dealing with stress and loneliness and my own behavior started to scare me. Whenever I was alone –which was the case very often- I would keep talking to myself or singing. When I forced myself to stop, it just went on in my head and got really tiring. So I decided to go to the psychological consultation offered at my university. The first appointment was very helpful because I really needed someone to tell me whether I was going crazy. The psychologist told me it was my choice whether I wanted to come again or not, and we set an appointment for a month later. Back then, I thought it was a good idea to give myself the feeling that I was seeking help and also to feel a bit encouraged/“pressured” to follow his advice before the next time. Since I was no longer in that hysterical state, the second session felt a bit unnecessary. I don’t like it when I keep complaining to others (although very often I feel that I need to do so) and of course I admitted that I was feeling a lot better. Nonetheless, I agreed to have a third session another 2 months later, so that I wouldn’t be “all on my own” from then on. However, the thought keeps bothering me that I am just seeking attention. In fact, it makes me feel super-attention-seeking, just writing that. I used to be a good student at school, and now this kind of recognition is missing at the university. I keep involving myself in voluntary work, but the only reason it makes me happy is that it gives me acknowledgement from others. When I go to a doctor (which I rarely do) now I somehow enjoy being the center of attention.

"For the past two years I’ve been going to a therapist and have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety and situational depression. Although it’s been going on since I was about eleven at least, that’s when I had my first major panic attack.

Furthermore, I cannot seem to sleep more than 4 hours, even with the melitonin my doctor prescribed me. My sleep deprivation has caused me to go into hysterics from crying and to laughing more than a few times. I’ve lost all interest in any activities I used to do in the past four years. I once danced, I quite that too now. I feel so emotionally disconnected from everyone. My family and friends notice it as well. Usually they’ll make fun of me or show real concern.

"I didn’t realize I was suffering from depression until many years into it. I finally went to a psychologist and psychiatrist when my life was falling apart. I felt awful and had felt awful for a very long time, but after getting on medications and feeling like a normal, happy person for a couple years, it all felt like an old unreal dream.

I only went to see a psychiatrist when I was 22, about a year after I moved out of my parents house. My parents are deniers of mental illness – the have a “pick yourself up by your bootstraps” / “you can’t possibly have depression” attitudes, so I always attributed my poor mental status to a character flaw.

"From Albania: Hello and thank you for reading this. Last July, my brother got married to the love of his life. They had been together for 10 years (since he was 20 and she 19), lived together for 2. She was the first and only girl he ever dated and was completely committed to raising a family with her. In November his wife started a new job, and in March this year she left him. He is completely devastated. When it happened, he cut off all relationships and we were not able to see or talk to him for a whole month. At that time he was still hoping that she would go back to him, and was waiting for her at their home. When it became clear that she wouldn’t come back, he moved back home with the family. For 2 weeks, he would just lay in bed staring at the ceiling, and couldn’t sleep at night. My mother and I stayed close to him and whenever he wanted to, we would talk and discuss what had happened with him. At least he started to go to work. He is a very introverted person, and he had invested so much in that relationship at the expense of other relationships in his life. He has very few friends and he is not really close to family members. It seemed that things got a bit better. He started going out at times, and he started sleeping again.

"Is this normal behavior for a parent to neglect spending time with their kid(s)? Before I turned 10, my childhood was good and I have fond memories of my family hanging out / doing activities together. However, after reaching the age of 10, my father just stopped bothering to spend time with his children. Over the years he acts like he wants to hang out but when time rolls around for the activity to take place, always comes up with excuse to not hang out (be it family activities or spending time with individual family members). This obviously hurt my feelings as a child (mainly because I would try to follow things up) and he would always get angry at me. I’m now a 29 year old adult, and he still claims to want to hang out from time to time. However I really don’t believe him and get annoyed with this behavior because I know he won’t follow through. Problem I have, is not that he won’t hang out. If he doesn’t value his family enough to spend time with them, that’s fine. But he acts like everyone else is to blame for this (even though he suggests hanging out, and other people have to follow up to see if event is really taking place).",,No Distortion,
Hi I am a 23 year old virgin. I was coming out of my shell and kissing and dating. I was really starting to enjoy life then I started having ED issues and my penis started to curve also. I was diagnosed with venous leak by a urologist. I had a complete nervous breakdown. I spent night after night hyper-ventilating and wishing for death as I felt totally worthless and very suicidal.

My libido went entirely and orgasm lost any mental benefit if anything it made me feel worse. This went on for a year.

"I was in a relationship with someone who abused me to the point I didn’t want to live anymore. He cheated on me, as well. He also allowed for his girlfriend to harass me. They even had sex and filmed it in my bed. After another physical attack, I called police. He’s still in jail months later. Recently, I was approached by a ‘mutual friend’. I was concerned, at first, but then talked it out and he assured me there was no connection. A month later, he brought another woman into my home and proceeded to be sexual with her while another of his friends was visiting. There is something wrong with me that this would go on.

I actually broke down and hid a video camera outside. It recorded her climbing in our bedroom window with my ex’s help. She did this while I was downstairs making dinner.

The new principal is a lay person who came from a completely different diocese (an “outsider”), however she is a professional whereas the former principal played favorites. Since the change two mothers have become verbally abusive to the current administrator, myself, and others. Furthermore, they do this in front of the children and other parents and they spread malicious gossip and rumors. It is escalating and my boss just shrugs her shoulders and says “oh well.” I have been employed here for 8 years and I have never had problems with these two mothers (or anyone for that matter) before the retirement of the former principal.

"I am a single mother of three boys and one daughter. My daughter will soon be 16 and I have been dating a man for two years. I feel that sometimes the behavior between my daughter and boyfriend is inappropriate. They will snuggle up on the couch and he puts his hand on her thigh, he holds her down and sits on top of her tickling her, he pulls her onto his lap, he gets on her case and tries to “tease” make her feel bad if she doesn’t sit next to him on the couch. I saw her at the kitchen sink and he came up behind her and put his hands on her waist. Things like that. Recently she had a crush on a boy and there was teenage drama for about a week all of which my boyfriend didn’t even really speak to my daughter. I almost felt like it was jealousy? On one hand I do not think he would ever harm my daughter. I tried to talk to him about behavior I feel is inappropriate and he thinks I am calling him a pedophile. Am I being unreasonable? What kind of behavior is ok and not ok? The kind of relationship I’ve always had with my father is completely opposite and I wonder if maybe that’s why I am feeling this way. It was hard for my dad to hug me and I never sat on his lap. My daughters dad left when she was 4 and is not in the picture and she has always tried to seek male approval.

This causes me to come off as stupid, or makes me seem that I don’t care.

I feel this is the right thing to do, but I always feel like I’ve don’t something wrong when I express this to my friends or co-workers. Growing up I always felt like I was an intelligent person. I never really thought like a child and was always more aware of myself and how my actions affected those around me than most other children. I love learning, but can’t seem to understand what people are saying to me. I’ve always had this inner monologue that is either pushing me to do something I don’t want to do, or just telling me negative things about myself. I’ve actually caught myself sometimes arguing out loud with this voice. It was me speaking the whole time, but in two different tones. Also I tend to see really horrible images in my head. For example if I see a plane flying by I’ll see it blowing up right in front of my eyes. Or if I’m see a person walking down the street I’ll see them getting hit by a car. I don’t want these things to happen and it really upsets me when I see them to the point where I’ll sometimes start crying. Right now I just had something happen at work that I feel terrible about and it affected everyone in the building. All I keep seeing is me running and jumping out the open window in the office before anyone could stop me. I wouldn’t do it, but I keep feeling this way.

"I recently ended a 3 year relationship with someone who I’ve realized was emotionally abusive. I started wondering if I was being abused about a year ago, and recently read an article on this website that seemed to detail exactly how I feel and how I was treated. The title of this article is ‘Emotional Abuse and the Impact of Absence.’ He would withdraw without telling me what was wrong, leaving me to guess. He would rarely apologize, and seemed to be emotionally unavailable. Sometimes his withdrawal was due to me being upset about something that had nothing to do with him. He was extremely critical of my children, and my family. He found fault in the way my kids walked too loud, held their fork wrong, a look on their face he didn’t like, etc. and claimed that it wasn’t their behavior that was the problem, but my lack of disciplining them for it. However, it seemed no matter how I responded, he would find fault with it, and I felt like I was walking on eggshells when he was around because I never knew what would irritate him next.  In the past, I have tried to tell him how his actions made me feel, and how it affected me, but he responded with defensiveness and I ended up feeling worse, like everything was my fault. I felt like I was accepting any crumb of affection or attention from him even though I knew I wasn’t being treated right. I quit trying to talk to him about my hurt feelings because I feared it would just make him withdraw more, and possibly end the relationship.

"Hi. I have a problem forming relationships with people. I’ve been working at this place for like 8 months and i still find it really difficult forming interpersonal relationships with everyone here. Not only people in the work place but also family members. I’ve noticed that every time I’m joking around and laughing with someone and getting along with them extremely well, i tend to back off and completely shut down after I’ve noticed that I’m happy or talking a lot. It’s really weird. I do have self-esteem issues and self-confidence issues and i believe i suffer from social anxiety and depression. I so badly want to form relationships with people but it’s like I’m not even allowing myself to you know? My childhood COULD have been better. My dad was a hermit and he didn’t talk to people that well and my mom was an alcoholic at the time so i don’t know if that has something to do with anything. I do remember that i was distant from people even when i was a kid as well. Well not so much distant but it seemed like i needed permission from my friends to go with them places, like i needed to know that i was needed and they liked being around me.

"My mom teaches at a private school and one of her students kept fighting with others. She asked me to go talk to him so I did. The more I talked to him the more signs of being a psychopath began to show. He claimed he had no remorse for hurting people. And he said calmly that he thought another kid was going to beat him up (A kid who I know personally would never do anything like that) and so he said he had to kill him. That kind of scared me but I made no comment in an attempt to not discourage him from talking to me. I talked to him some more and I remembered that previously I had heard about some kids thinking that only weak people care about others. So I asked him if he thought that was true and he said yes. I asked him if his mom cared about him (which I know that she does, I’m friends with her) and he said yes. I asked him if that meant she was weak and he said yes. He then continued to say that he would like his mom more if she didn’t fake committing suicide, which from the way he told it, sounding like she was going to commit suicide then stopped because she realized that would leave him and his 4 year old sister parent-less.

I attempted to explain that she just really cared about him and that she didn’t want him to end up living with people that were mean to him. I asked him if he would like living with people that were mean to him and he calmly replied, “I wouldn’t care. They’d probably have knives and I’d kill them.” I asked if he knew that when people died in real life they didn’t come back to life and he said that of course he knew that. He went on to say that he enjoyed hurting people. I knew that he couldn’t hurt me much so I told him that if he liked hurting people so much he could hurt me. So he hit me then burst into tears.

" Hi..in the past, I’d say about 2 years, on and off again I experience drastic mood swings that can cause me to feel empowered and ambitious, or empty and dead. However they are not spontaneous..usually (90% or more of the time) they are caused by me being paranoid and possessive of my boyfriend. I trust him and he has never done anything to make me feel otherwise; but I still feel like I can’t let my guard down. For example, I could go from being in an ecstatic mood and be on top of the world and a chick could talk to him about homework or how to contact him ; anything and I’d automatically get in a rut. On top of this, I feel like I consistently need to be paid attention to by people close to me, but I hate being in the spotlight! I like being alone most of the time and prefer everyone to keep their distance from me yet I feel like I need some sort of praise from him, my family, my *close* friends. It’s getting kind of hard to deal with because when I get in the “empty” state of mind I feel unmotivated and end up neglecting school work, chores, activities, everything. I feel like it is not worth the trouble of dealing with and this just drives me deeper in since the lack of work ethic makes the future even harder to deal with.

He was driving at the time and would often leave the car on the side of the road, twice a major interstate highway!

"Need help dealing with high conflict ex-wife of boyfriend. They share custody of 3 teens; divorced 7 years. He let her stay in his house while between apartments after getting evicted, but then stayed 8 months longer while all the kids lived there and she continued to collect child support and stay overnight with her new bf. She has bad credit and dogs so this was her excuse for not being able to find a home. When he insisted that she leave she got angry and left her dogs behind. This is the second set of dogs she has abandoned and one set has lived with my bf for 7 years now. He refuses to keep another two dogs and has told her she must take them. Her solution was to take them to the shelter with his 14 year old son, telling him his father was forcing her to do it, that his father is selfish for not letting her leave the dogs “for just another few weeks.” My bf’s son, who is a “young” 14, is sad and angry at his father, which is typical of these scenarios. This isn’t, as you might imagine, just about the dogs – boundaries that are enforced are punished through the kids. I encourage him to keep strong boundaries and he does increasingly so. In the big picture, I think it is the right thing to do for him and his children, but the stress of these constant “punishments” is making him physically sick. He spent years bending over backwards so as to keep some kind of relationship with his children, but they are older now (and he is late 50s and exhausted) and is really trying to change the dynamic. Yesterday, she stole his EZ pass out of his car and had her oldest daughter text him that they needed to go on a college visit (note that she already receives 40k a year post tax for the kids, works part time, so desperate for $ is kooky). I would call the police for even small infractions to make a point, but my bf knows only his kids will suffer and he just can’t stand to watch.

"I think some things are wrong with me, but due to insurance issues we never could quite afford a psychiatrist. I’ve been to rehab a few times, and I did get to see one there, but the doctor only came in once a week for one hour, in those four months, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, Bulimia, Depression, and anxiety. Which was a lot to take in, since it was rehab and state paid, the meds weren’t that great. I fear there is more wrong with me and I have tried to tell my mum about what happens but she just kinda pushes it under the rug. I will explain now some of the things I feel… – I for some reason don’t have a conscience, now, I don’t particularly get the urge to hurt animals or people, but I don’t really get sad when it happens. I don’t feel anything when I do something wrong, I wonder why that is. It’s like I can’t feel guilty. It just doesn’t exist. I started doing heroin to deal with things when I was seventeen.

There has always been a part of me that’s doubted whether or not I really want to do musical theatre for my life, but this year that part of me has gotten so much bigger. I’m not passionate about it anymore, and I don’t know if it’s the program or not.

I tell myself it doesn’t really matter because I’d always planned to kill myself by the time I was 30 anyway.

I also applied to a huge state school that’s 10 mins away from me and I could commute to and 50% of my high school goes to. My parents don’t know about this. They don’t have much of a theatre program at all. I could go there and live at home, but not major in theatre.

"My boyfriend and I have been living together for almost a year. I know that he is the man that I am going to spend my life with and I have no doubts about that. We live in his home with his parents and because they are not working we completely support them and pay for everything. His mom has a multitude of health issues and is in her 50s she hasn’t worked in over 20 years. His dad is 46 and stopped working after hurting his knee at work when my boyfriend was 18. Since then my boyfriend has been supporting them completely. My boyfriend is a caring and loving man and his parents take advantage of him. They are not appreciative and always expect him to provide them with whatever they want—his dad in particular. At first when I moved in things were okay but recently it has been very hard. His parents both smoke in the house and no matter how many times we talk to them about it, it continues. They are constantly in our business and wanting us to run and get them things. Recently his dad came into a decent amount of money and with that money he was supposed to buy a vehicle, he did not. Instead his dad takes my car almost everyday and is gone until it’s time for me to go to work which just leaves me sitting at home. I want so badly to move out and have our own place just me and my boyfriend. But we cannot afford to pay for our own place and a place for his parents. My boyfriend is completely unwilling to wean his parents off of his support and I fear that we are going to be stuck living in the same home with them forever. We are only 25 and it feels like we are never going to have the chance to have our own family. I get so angry because his father is mostly just lazy and unwilling to work and would rather just have his son take care of him forever. He has the attitude of an unable elderly man when in actuality he is younger than my parents who both work. My dad had the same knee injury as him and got it fixed then went back to work.

"When I was in the 8th grade around age 13-14, I was diagnosed with psychotic depression. Symptoms included hearing voices (inside my head, not outside), occasional visual hallucinations, self-injury and suicidal ideation. Each voice had a name and their own personality, and not all of the voices were negative. They interacted with each other and also with me. I was put on a high dose of risperidone and symptoms began to decrease, and I stopped seeing a psychiatrist. I am now 17 years old, and recently, I’ve been having inner dialogue going on between my own consciousness and two voices that are not created consciously by me. I am female and they are both male. One is the same age as me and one is around 19 or 20 and they both have their own names and personalities, similar to what I experienced when I was younger. Now, however, I’m noticing that I’m becoming more and more forgetful of what I’ve done and sometimes what I’m in the process of doing. For instance I’ve received classwork and exams handed back to me with my name on it that are written in different handwriting that I don’t remember doing. My friends will ask me if I remember something we talked about yesterday or even earlier the same day and I won’t recall what they’re talking about. Sometimes I’ll be in the middle of doing something and I suddenly forget what I was doing and have to ask my friend what I was just talking about. However, at times, one of the voices will say “Oh yeah I remember that!” or they’ll say “we were in the middle of doing this,” most of the time being correct. I’m concerned and confused about what’s been going on. I’m not sure if I’m having another psychotic episode and I’m delusional or if I might have signs of DID.

My family has had a history of mental illness/disorders, my grandmother suffered from sociopathy and we believe that her mother was schizoid. Recently, I have begun thinking that something is wrong with me, too. I’ve tried to recall moments in my life when I have shown what some people call “concerning” traits/perspectives and there has been a lot. I seem to prey on people who are “helpless,” people who need shoulders to cry on and once I have their trust, I turn on them. I have contemplated suicide, but not because I was depressed but because my life is routine and routine is boring and being bored is probably one of the worst feelings. I have been in trouble quite a lot during primary school and the start of secondary, due to my attitude to the imbeciles in my class- I always say snide things about them and I have found myself trying to provoke a fight, which makes no sense because it is not logical because they are nothing to me and any retort they make to my arguments simply wouldn’t be worth listening to- it would be like listening to a newborn try to come up with a valid argument."," I have contemplated suicide, but not because I was depressed but because my life is routine and routine is boring and being bored is probably one of the worst feelings.

He tells me all the time it’s his mother’s fault for his problems and how she makes things worse, but of course he would never tell her that.

I’ve taken lots of different kinds of medication but they don’t work at all (except for Xanax). One of the problems I’ve been having is that I don’t seem to react to situations the way people around me do. I’m hypersensitive about what people think about me. Sometimes I get really upset about great things. I recently met a great girl and we got along really well so I started crying and tried to kill myself. Other times, people will hurt me and do really bad things to me, and it makes me laugh. If I get too excited about something like a new job, a trip to somewhere fun or even just a really good song, it makes me want to die. But at the same time I’m happy… Sometimes I think about hurting people I care about to show them how much I love them. When my friends do nice things for me, I want to stab them and hold them in my arms but I know that’s not polite. I avoid certain social situations like parties because I fear my excitement may cause me to become suicidal. It’s all really confusing. Is there anything I can do to be more like normal people? I want to be a good person; I don’t want to be evil.",,No Distortion,

But recently (as I have been abroad and separated from the people I love), I have started worrying a lot that I will get psychosis. That’s when a weird feeling in my head started.

I have recently been doing this thing where if I remember an extremely stressful experience or I recall something I’ve been procrastinating (cleaning a room,homework,organizing emails etc.)/an embarrassing memory my mind feels as if it shakes and only focuses on those memories and I involuntarily (I don’t know how to describe it other as being possessed by the memories) lose control of my hands and they/my shoulders tremor (my fingers lose control and shake in the air in a motion like piano playing, and my shoulders jerk back and forth) and my whole body shakes until I push the certain memory away or focus on gripping a table/my phone and then it calms to only my fingers/hand twitching until I calm down enough to be level-headed. It’s psychically tolling and I am always mentally and psychically exhausted after calming. It is only a thing that has happened in the past year. It can also happen in random spikes, even when I am not breaking-down; as when I’m sitting with friends or out at the movies my hands will take control of themselves and tremor.

I ended up falling in love with the city and landing a job that I felt proud of, with excellent benefits to boot. In 2014 we had our first child together after a rough pregnancy where i was mostly confined at home sick. Sometime in 2014 it was decided we were going to move back to our home state (a state i never missed or wanted to go back to) after doing some math and realizing it would be more affordable to raise a child. Throughout that year i expressed that I really didnt want to go back, that i loved where i was, etc. His reply back was always that he wanted to go back to warmer weather (he hated the cold), a place where we had friends and was more affordable. Admittedly he did angrily say on multiple occassion that we could stay – but i knew that he didnt want to. I felt guilty keeping him and also didnt want to deal with someone miserable with their situation.

"Ever since I was 10, I have been experiencing homicidal thoughts. They just keep getting worse, and I’m scared that thoughts will become actions. I have enjoyed horror films and shows since I was very young, but I always knew that killing was bad. Now, it’s all I think about. I dream of torturing and murdering random people in gory and grotesque ways. I very much enjoy the feeling I get, but at the same time, I know I cant afford to kill anyone. The urge is very strong to, though, and it affects my daily life in several ways, including mood swings. My parents are very concerned and are trying to get me some counseling, but for the time being, what should I do about all this?

"I have been dating and living with my boyfriend for 18 months. He cheated with his ex from the start and for the first 6 months of our relationship. I caught him, he lied, then confessed – several times. He claimed he loved me and wanted me. (He told me that they were over when we got together, but he did NOT tell me that while they were indeed split up, he’d been desperately trying to get her back for 2 years and was still trying and couldn’t get over her.)  So, he claims he is finally over her now and sees her for the horrid person she is. He loves and wants me. I believe him (reluctantly and somewhat suspiciously). I am trying to trust him. Ex says she doesn’t want him but was just trying to break us up by seeing him.

He said that it is something he cannot control since it happens automatically, which tells me he has had this habit for a long time. When I notice a good-looking person, I do not stare at their crotch wondering what size it is, or point them out when I am in a relationship. For me, I’d be happier if he noticed a beautiful person, not pointed them out and moved on. Apparently with his past relationships he was comfortable pointing them out, but I’m not. He has agreed to not point them out, and says he feels like he has to be conscious about what he says around me and that he feels more like himself with his friends. I have stressed about this for over 3 weeks and I feel it is ruining our relationship.

"My boyfriend overreacts over the smallest things. For example, I was with my uncle for lunch and a few errands. He called me 4 times while I was with him and finally I told him that I would call him after we got done eating. I ended up not calling until I took my uncle back home because I didn’t think it was that big of a deal for me not to call my boyfriend for another 25 minutes. During the time that I was driving my uncle home, he texted me 6 times, hurtful things. Another example, when he got home the other night I was sitting in the kitchen looking on my phone and he got insanely mad the second he saw me. He said that I didnt care and I would be better off with someone else because I was on my phone!

They consist of a female voice with a british accent,who I call Mary, and a male voice I call Adonis. Adonis is really aggressive and mean to me and others.

Mary is appearing much less than Adonis but she can make everything shake.

"Hello, So I’m 15 and under medication for (suicidal)depression (I take clomipramine). I have dealt with self harm and such issues and my depression is under control. Recently though, I started noticing that everything wasn’t going ok. I’ll explain: I feel tired all day but I get overwhelmed by anger and hate. I fantasize about hurting and even killing people, though i would never do this in real life. I feel like those things are getting worse fast.It feels like there are two “ME”s : one kind person and one mean, angry version of myself (I “bathe” in this anger and let it overwhelm me, it makes me feel powerful).","I feel like those things are getting worse fast.It feels like there are two “ME”s : one kind person and one mean, angry version of myself (I “bathe” in this anger and let it overwhelm me, it makes me feel powerful).",Mental filter,
"Thank you for your time. I’m not that skilled with words so I apologize if this does not make sense. I am a student athlete who holds several leadership positions on campus. To everyone I seem great but in reality I’m not even close to being okay. Between all of my commitments I am completely overwhelmed. Nothing is fun anymore and has not been for some time now. Also, I often find myself faced with a deep and powerful hatred toward myself and my mind is often consumed with the notion that I deserve to die. It has progressed to the point that I have been considering suicide as a valid and logical option. Even though cognitively I recognize that it should not even be a consideration. I fight this everyday and I am afraid of what might happen if I lose control for even a little while. That’s why I so strictly maintain the façade of being completely fine. I fear that if I even allow myself to admit that I am not fine then I would cease to be able to function. The most frustrating part of this whole situation is that there is no reason for it. My life has been great and there is a copious amount of objective evidence that would indicate that I have no reason and no right to feel like this. I’m an intensely private and independent person who struggles to open up. So my question is, how do I get past this on my own?","Also, I often find myself faced with a deep and powerful hatred toward myself and my mind is often consumed with the notion that I deserve to die.

"Hi, I am 15 years old and about three months ago I had a “Panic Attack” in bed at night. Since then at night-time I have this extreme fear. This includes heart palpation, trembling, numbing in hands and feet, fast breathing, fearful thoughts such as someone breaking in, ghosts creepy dolls you name it! I also sweat and feel extreme nausea the whole time. Because of this, trying to sleep is a problem as I can’t stop thinking of the fear, I can’t close my eyes for more than 5 seconds and if I want to sleep I have to have a video on and sometimes my lamp on though sometimes it is impossible to shut my mind off. It used to be much worse than now as I don’t have it regularly and can kind of control it but i do have my days. From what I have googled I cannot find many people with the same problem. I also have experienced waking up with my whole body numb, with loud ringing in my ears heart pounding and difficulty breathing. It is like I am in a bag as I feel detached from reality. When it is over however it feels like it never happened (btw I can move a bit but very difficult) it has happened twice but it terrifies me . I also have no idea what that is and when I went to the doctor he was not helpful AT ALL. I have been to counseling but the problem has not been solved. I get very stressed easily and have my fair share of anxiety in the day too. I am quite a healthy in size yet I don’t exercise and my diet could be better. I am just wondering what the fear at night is and if it may be possibly linked to stress during the day. Thanks a lot for taking your time to read this.

"I found out my wife of 15 years was having an emotional affair with a friend of mine as a result of me being a poor husband. At what point do I stop trying to repair the damage? She has admitted the affair. She’s stating that she no longer speaks with him, but I question that. She is still very guarded of her phone, still friends with him on Facebook, etc. The reason she started the affair, and I’ve taken responsibility for this, was due to the fact that I put my work and mainly my hobbies ahead of my family for most of my marriage. I always thought she was supporting me in my hobby, but she says she was very unhappy.  And looking back I can see that now. Wish I had seen it then. However, she never told me point blank how unhappy she was. I found out about how unhappy she was about 3 months ago. I made wholesale changes in my life. I dropped my hobby right away. Starred spending as much time at home as I could. I put her and our daughter where they should have always been, first in my life. But something still seemed a little off. Then about 6 weeks into trying to work on our marriage( me doing most of the work, which I was fine with) I found out about this emotional affair. It devastated me. So now, another 6 weeks has passed. Things haven’t gotten much better. She says she’s done with him, but I question that as I said. I am still trying very hard to fix my mistakes and prove I’ve changed. However, I don’t feel she’s doing the same. My question is, because of my failures which I feel lead to the affair, should I be willing to give her more “time” to get to the point of working on her issues? It’s very difficult for me to handle the constant secrecy with her phone. I want to take it and see if she’s still contacting him, but I’m afraid that will crush any progress we may be making. I still love her very much and I do want to work this out. But at what point do my feelings and concerns become part of the equation? Thanks.

"I was diagnosed with schizophrenia this year. Ever since I was diagnosed people have been acting as if I’m a violent person. I see violent things, but would never act on them, I’m not violent at all. I don’t have a history of violence, but I’ve been seeing things since I was 14. Oh I’ve had the occasional fight like anyone else, but not acted out in violence unprovoked or for no reason. I only fight when someone hurts me or my family members.

Even my therapists try putting me in the hospital every single time I go off my meds (I take haloperidol and can’t currently because my gallbladder makes me throw up when I take any meds or eat anything) because “you’re a danger to yourself and others right now.” I only started taking the meds this year, 21 years after the problems started.

It was unacceptable if I got a B, it wasn’t “good enough.” However even though she had a job she would sleep all the time and would always be crying. It got to the point that between work and sleeping she didn’t have time for any of the normal mom things. She stopped doing laundry, cleaning, coming to my basketball games, and so I picked up her slack. Ever since I’ve been doing all my families laundry, cleaning the house, planning out what we need from the grocery store every week and if she ever offered to for example do the dishes so I could go to bed I’d wake up the next morning and they wouldn’t be done. Whenever I would talk to my dad about her he would say that that’s just how she is now because of her brain and that whenever she freaked out on me to not take it personally. Recently me and my mom were driving to Pennsylvania to visit family and she had a panic attack while driving she swore that the truck drivers were out to get her so she pulled over for an hour trying to “clear her head”. Also every time I try to talk to her about a problem with a guy or anything she turns it into her problem and I always end up holding her while she can’t stop crying. All of this started, because she lost the baby and after she lost the baby it was like I wasn’t good enough for her. I wasn’t a good enough reason for her to try to get better I wasn’t good enough to keep her happy I wasn’t good enough for her because I got a 92 in biology and “ruined my chances of going to a good college.” If I’ve never been good enough for her then how can I be good enough to help her?

"I have been in this relationship for almost a year now and I am currently struggling with my bf insecurities. He thinks he is short, not attractive enough and that he is not considered a man in the outside. I knew from the begining of the relationship so I went great lengths to boost his trust (without him knowing I know his insecurities). I had no result whatsoever. Lately I have found a forum where he is posting and saying that there is nothing more “soul crushing” than to be a manlet. Problem is his insecurities affect me too. I am hurt that he feels this way, I am sad and I feel I don’t suffice. Even worse, I can’t trust him and I feel the need of snooping–only sometimes– to make sure he doesn’t do something harmful to us. Now I want to help him overcome these insecurities, but I am aware I might never could. I tried to explain to him that he is really not short 5ft8 and that I don’t see him like that and that he should accept him and play the card he is being given. IT doesn’t work he says he accepted it but he will always hate his height. I really want to know an expert opinion in regard to what should I do next. Should I accept his insecurities and back away? Should I get angry and tell him to man up and focus on other aspects in life? And moreover how can I stop his insecurities to affect me? (From Romania)",,No Distortion,

"My Dad and I usually get on quite well. We have a lot in common, but whenever he cooks or cleans he doesn’t do the job properly. For instance, he won’t wash his hands before cooking or clean the sides down properly. I’m generally not that bothered by germs but everyone knows the basics of hygiene in the kitchen. I try to tell him that he should wash his hands, but he just get annoyed, and makes some excuse like he’s ‘thinking about other things’. 9 times out of 10 he doesn’t do the washing up properly either eg. there will still be oil on the frying pan. So when I try to do it or I tell him that it’s unclean he just gets irritated and says “your being rather annoying now” when I’m just trying to makes sure my sister and I get a healthy meal in a clean kitchen. My mum usually makes sure that the kitchen and everything else is clean but she’s away seeing her parents because my grandma’s going into surgery soon. Now my dad’s left with us he just seems incapable of doing even basic chores. I can’t keep pestering him but he doesn’t learn.

"Doctor, I’m lost. When I was three years old I told my mother I was responsible for her father’s death (died of a heart attack when I was 2 months old). Over the years I’ve had issues, first insomnia when I was seven (couldn’t stop thinking of the homeless sleeping under the rain). Always rebellious in school, I was diagnosed hyperactive and given ritalin when I was 10. I was later “disdiagnosed”. I often refused to go seek therapy because I thought “I’m not crazy”. I was in boarding school from 13-18, I was beaten up pretty badly when I was in my first year there because I disrespected the upper years. I had a couple of crushes throughout my life, none of which worked out or really mattered until a girl called Anna, my first love. She smashed my heart and got a boyfriend but I didn’t give up leading to further pain and pushed me to drink a lot. I started smoking weed when I was 16, it started with a gram/week but gradually built up to 10g/week (4months ago). Recently, 1 month and a half ago, a friend fell in a psychosis, came out to me. I told him I was straight but respected his way. He asked me to teach him how to live, and tried to kiss me twice. I was so scared that night, locked myself in my room scared he’d come rape me. For the following weeks I asked myself whether I might be gay and hadn’t realized. It didn’t bother me until one night after I hit a rough patch with a girl I love, and a friend said he thought I was gay as we were smoking. Henceforth I was convinced I was, for 3 weeks I kept smoking (5g/day by the end) thinking it would make it stop. When I got back to Paris I saw 2addiction experts and one psychiatrist, the first two said it was a bad trip and would pass with some time and antipsychotics. The second said it was anxiety related and triggered by weed-abuse.I then decided to get hospitalized and they said it was acute psychosis, sign of bipolarity or schizophrenia and that I could never drink or touch any drug again. I’m unsure of who to believe or what’s going on. I now know I’m straight but I now fear I’m suffering from the aforementioned illnesses.

"Hi there, I’m torn between accepting or rejecting a diagnosis of Bipolar II. A clinical psychologist diagnosed me with Bipolar II a week ago and now I am under a primary care physician to receive mood stabilizing medication this week. I don’t think I have bipolar disorder though. Can personality not sometimes resemble bipolar? I am sometimes hyperactive and able to take on a 100 projects, feel super smart and pretty and am at the top of my game. I need little sleep and in fact find sleep an annoying timewaster. Then I have times, probably more often, where I feel sorry for myself, feel ugly, stupid and can barely clean my flat or look after my pets. When I’m hyper, I harm no one, I don’t spend too much or gamble or drink or do anything that could be considered damaging. I just work really hard, accomplish a lot (I work fulltime as a project manager, am a freelance educational writer and am in the third year of a science degree for which I have had 18 distinctions so far). When I am down, I do feel very sad and think of killing myself every now and then, but I would never kill myself as I know logically this would be stupid and that I always feel better again. In my mind, I am just a highly functional individual who is able to achieve a lot, use my time to the max, sometimes feeling on the top of the world and sometimes not. I’m used to feeling like this and I have all sorts of coping mechanisms around it. I am completely alone, no family and few uninvolved friends, so my state of mood never affects anyone. I also have no support structure should it really be bipolar and should I need help. I don’t understand why I should go on mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. I’ve had no breaks with reality, just a few very minor private breakdowns where I have cried a lot. But I got over those and I was just overworked and under a lot of pressure and it didn’t affect anyone other than me. What do you do when you are torn between accepting a diagnosis and thinking it is total nonsense? I change my mind at least 20 times a day. I can’t imagine I will be able to be compliant with taking medication or accepting help.

"Often I’m troubled with specific lines from song verses and insults towards myself that get repeated in my head over and over again. Sometimes it won’t stop for forty five minutes to an hour. It happens at random times. For example, i’ll wake up in the morning with only the first line of a chorus stuck in my head and it’ll just keep repeating until it fades away on its own. The insults: I feel if I don’t repeatedly say them to myself out loud they’ll just repeat in my head like the song lyric. The insults are explicit and I don’t mean to call myself such derogatory things but I feel like they’re being directed at me by someone else in my head. I have to keep repeating them until I feel I don’t need to anymore. I do have terrible anxiety and both issues get worse when I’m more anxious than my baseline level of anxiety that’s always with me. I never feel like there’s a quiet moment in my head.

I can only sleep after I stay up so late that I exhaust myself completely and that’s when some of my brain slows down. I never know how i’m going to wake up feeling or “who”, in a sense, i’m going to wake up as. I feel as if that confusion also stems from the  rapid fire of thoughts always in my head. One moment i’m thinking of a fun memory, the next instant i’m thinking of death, then philosophy, then my future, then video games, then literature . . . it just goes on and on like someone repeatedly opens an encyclopedia, randomly points to a definition, then immediately flips to a different page and randomly chooses another definition before I could read the first definition.

"From the U.S.: For about 7 years now I can barely get through a conversation without crying. It’s humiliating and is uncomfortable for everyone involved. Anything can trigger it but I seem to have narrowed it down to three general triggers. All of these triggers are things that I normally would never give a second thought let alone burst into tears about. 1) Any large group activity – baseball games, choir performances, kids school performances. If a group is together and I’m part of it, at some point I cry. 2) When anyone shares anything the least bit sentimental. For example – a friend of mine was talking about her son’s kindergarten graduation. His teacher taught the kids the sign language sign for “I love you” so that the next year that would be their secret signal around the school. Cute right? Cute. She was telling me this and I burst into tears! To the point I couldn’t speak. This happens all the time. 3) Anytime I have to speak about anything spiritual. I’ve almost stopped going to church.

"To start, I should explain I’ve always been rather imaginative, a trait which hasn’t been lost as I’ve matured. I could think things into being, see the future, and I’d caused the death of my grandfather by picking up a penny which’d been facing tails-up. Mind you, I was well into high school and still find clues and symbolism where I know they certainly don’t reside. But these do me no harm, really. The most harmful of these was an obsession with my weight. The fear of becoming fat slowly morphed to the fear that I was already fat and my perception was warped, which soon escalated to the accusation that everyone else was keeping what I really looked like from me, frequently dropping hints as a sot of inside-joke. The size on my trousers had been changed as well-an idea I knew was impossible, yet still entertained. Needless to say, I became obsessive over the intake and burning of calories. Then, a couple years later, a light clicked and I realized how delusional I was. Mind you, the weaning process was slow and steady-it took months before I could drink juice without becoming anxious-but self-awareness is the first step to recovery. I’m learning, unfortunately, that this is an issue which doesn’t simply disappear. As of late, I’ve become aware of those same vain whispers. They are beginning to resurface and though they aren’t as loud as before, they seem to be getting harder to ignore. In October of last year, my family and I went on a picnic, to which I wore a sort-of-midriff. When my mother sent me the pictures she’d taken, I had so much anxiety I cried. It was such a dreadful panic. I thought I was over my fear of weight-gain, but something as simple as a picture set me off. Logically, I know I’m thin, yet I can’t fully convince myself. These thoughts have been building, and I’ve been trying to ignore them, but it isn’t working. I’m so terrified of this fear regaining its strength and avoid activities or clothes which may trigger the anxiety. How might I put an end to this before it becomes severe?

I’m an eighteen year old girl whose very confused about herself and had to grow up way too fast and just keeps her problems to herself because no one will understand, I know you would like to get to the root, so I will just get to the point. 1) When I am in a bathroom, I feel someone is going to come out of the stalls and kill me. Also, if I am an elevator or a large hall by myself, I begin to feel pressure in my face and body to the point where I have to put hands over my ears like a child and is paralyzed.

But I know that their is something wrong here. Whats up with that? 2)I am very socially weird and growing up I heard sex is just something that will damn you to hell if you do it, because you get pregnant. In high school I was a virgin and did everything perfect and didn’t want to look bad in the eyes of the lord or others. However, my hormones would kick in. SEX!! I couldn’t stop the feeling. I needed it like air. When I would make out with guys, a weird sensation would happen and I would breathe heavily ( not like I am having an asthma attack or anything I was just fine) and just tremble like I am gasping for air. Even when I thought about it too much it would happen either before or after I would make out with a guy or even think about it. 3) Lastly, I have voices that talk to me in my head. There is eight of them inside of me. They all have names and personalities of there own. Bobbi is the bad one and he makes me want to hurt other…just impulses to kill someone or just choke them. Phoebe is a sexual predator and will want to kidnap someone to make them her personal play toy….the others are harmless but enhance my mood to their personality.

"I’ve become very concerned for my friend over the past few months, and even more so as recently I went through her notes on her phone when she let me borrow it to text my parents. First off, I’d noticed that she’d lost quite a bit of weight since winter break, at least 15-20 pounds off an already slender frame. It wasn’t just the weight, she hasn’t eaten lunch at school these past months either, and whenever we eat out somewhere on the weekends she hardly touches her plate even though she only orders a salad. Also, she always quickly types on her phone before eating — this is what compelled me to go on her notes, just to see if there was anything, and there was. She has a folder documenting her height and weights, morning and evening, with exact times, from the past 6 months; 5’4″ she started at 120lbs and is now down to 105lbs She also has weights labeled GW and UGW- 100 and 97, respectively. She has a folder in which she’s typed up rules for herself varying from “consume 200-800 calories daily” and “fast once a week”, to “exercise 30- 90 minutes 6X/week”. Also she has one labeled food journal but I didn’t get to look at it because I didn’t want to arouse suspicion for taking too long.

I think I love said girl and I’m really happy with said girl. Said girl introduces me to many friends and we all form this strong bond. A friendship we all deeply loved, trusted, and admired. I’ll call this said girl B. Now, one night when B isn’t around I’m hanging out with other friends (and this is about 3 years ago) and this girl, I’l call her Q, kisses me and it’s /wonderful/. I loved it. Q ends up coming over to my home and she has sex with me. She tells me, ‘What if we were together?’ and I get so happy. I stop ties with B.

"I started cutting myself like two months ago and I can’t stop. I have been so insecure since forever, I have always hated my self and then my sister stopped eating so she began calling me fat. Every single day, and even my dad talked about my weight :( so one night I was in the kitchen and my dad had his razor blade on the counter, no body was in the kitchen..so I cut my arm. I really liked the feeling of cutting, and it took my mind off things. A couple days later, my mom looked at my arms and she saw weird scars, and she knew I cut myself. So I had to explain everything to her and how I felt about my self. She told my dad and my sister and then it turned in to this whole big thing, but she never sent me to therapy or asked for my blade back.

"I moved to my husband’s country where I haven’t been able to work and now I have started to hate him. 1 year and 3 months ago I moved to my husband’s country for his job. The place we live is beautiful and I speak the language fluently however due to visa delays I haven’t been allowed to work since moving here. Before moving here, he had always promised me a work permit would not be a problem at all. 1.5 years is a VERY long time to keep yourself busy doing volunteering, or getting to know the city, or exercising or doing all these things that people in my position are told to do, and believe me, I do all of these intensively. Bottom line however, those activities do not fulfill my inner ambitions in the long run. I had a very good paying job in my home country, and I simply can’t stand being financially dependent on him anymore. I had lots of friends and here I know absolutely no one so we are together 24/7 — we have run out of things to tell each other. I’m very outgoing, so I’m always trying to make new friends, but at my age it’s much more difficult to connect.. On top of it, he is excelling and experiencing huge success in his job, while I have become this wreck, a shadow of myself and have watched my self-esteem literally disappear. I feel I’ve been reduced to being a cook, cleaner and errand-runner and I feel completely dumb and impotent because I do not have self-validating experiences. I have realized how I’m trying to distance myself from him because I am just so angry at this situation he has put me in,I feel he deceived me. My patience has run out and I’ve started to have some very negative thoughts. He has started to ask me to try for a baby but I feel that with a child in a place with no family I will have even less opportunity of finding a job.

Replaying the memories in my head doesn’t upset me, I feel nothing at all. My problem is that I am obsessed with rape. I can’t stop compulsively seeking out movies and tv shows with rape in them. I don’t get pleasure from this, instead it’s like a form of self-harm. I get so hysterically upset from watching rape scenes, they give me what I call “emotional flashbacks” where I feel like it’s happening to me now, and I can feel all of the emotions that I felt during my own rape. I don’t know why I do this because it hurts me so much, and it takes hours to recover from. It’s like I need to trigger myself with these scenes and feel these things in order to prove to myself that my experiences were real, since my memories are so pathetic and easy to doubt. I usually feel so numb about my abuse, triggering myself like this is the only way I can make myself feel. I can’t stop, I think about rape all the time, it’s always in the back of my mind, and whenever I hear about a rape scene in a movie, I look it up right away, even though I know that doing so will hurt me. Why do I do this? What’s wrong with me? (age 24, from UK)","I am so mad at myself for not being able to remember more, it makes me feel like maybe I’m making the whole thing up.

My fiance has been out of town the last few weeks so I am alone in the house. After several minutes of panic, I convinced myself I was hearing things and went back to sleep.  Next, I was dreaming and then awoke to someone in bed lying next to me (spooning me) I said my fiance’s name several times and the person put their leg over mine, pinning me and grabbed my hair pulling it firmly. I laid perfectly still for awhile until I realized I no longer felt the presence and then confirmed no one was there. I thought maybe I dozed for a second and the person must have gotten up and was in the house elsewhere. It’s now a few hours later and I am still in my bedroom.  As daylight is coming I am feeling safer. I am certain I must be hallucinating but it was SO REAL. I have never done drugs in my life and I am not on any medication except for 2 days ago I took 1 Zyrtec and used flonase for the very first and only time for allergies.  I saw an allergist about a week ago because of allergies and chest pain with shortness of breath.  I tested positive for the pollen allergies and do not have asthma. I suffered from PTSD in the past due to death of a child 7 years ago. I had hallucinations at that time where I believed I had witnessed my husband getting out of bed to answer the door and talking to people before coming back to bed.  When I asked him about it the next morning he said it never happened.

I had two childhood friends who I used to spend most of my days with since the second grade. After the transition from middle school to high school, they both have found different groups of friends, and I have lost all connection with them. I have found some substitutes for them, a group of people who I used to go to the same middle school with. I never really talked much with them until I had class with them. To this day, I would not really consider them friends, but more of acquaintances. I mainly just used them to have a group of friends to hang around with during lunch time.

"Hi, I am 14 years old, and I have had problems pulling and messing with my hair in a variety of different ways since I was little. I noticed my grandma and mom also did this, I always told them to stop, until I noticed I did it too. I thought this was just a bad habit, until I stumbled across the word Trichotillomania online. I googled what it was and I found myself wondering if I had it. Only, I am not sure if I have it or not. I don’t exactly pull out my hair for the sensation of pulling it out. I pull/tug on the ends of my hair repeatedly to the extent where it tears split ends and as a result hair comes out. I get a weird satisfaction by pulling off my split ends which makes them worse. But, I am not sure if this classifies as Trichotillomania because I don’t notice balding, only minor thinning if that. I guess I mainly like the feeling of my hair getting pulled repeatedly and thats why I do it I am not sure. I have terrible split ends and sometimes the tugging on my scalp gives me headaches, but this doesn’t really match with the definition of Trichotillomania. I am not sure if this is a big deal or not, just multiple people have pointed it out, and I do it constantly. And when I say constantly I mean literally anytime my hands aren’t already doing something. I find myself doing this when I am bored or anxious.

Since then we’ve had a good relationship up until recently. He lost his job and is very stressed out and nervous because of it. He is always moody, snaps easily, and has no understanding for my wanting to talk things out and be understood when arguments come up. When I try to peace things out in a caring and loving manner he gets angry and says that he hates how we have to drag things out all the time. I try to explain to him that I want reassurance that he really wants to be here this time and the conversations become longer because I’m waiting to hear something reassuring from him while all he does it get angry and try to brush me off. He tells me he wants me to be his wife one day, that he wants to have a family with me and that he’s in love with me, yet I don’t feel it. I don’t know if it’s just from his moods or not, but I am scared that he is only saying this because he’s afraid to hurt me again. When he is in a good mood he is more loving and caring, but that almost never happens anymore. When he got angry yesterday he said that our arguments makes him doubt whether he wants to do this for the rest of his life, and it broke my heart. Should I leave him be when he gets in his moods or am I right in wanting to be reassured without having him get mad?","He broke it off once with me because we had been fighting a lot, mainly because I created arguments because I didn’t feel like he was in the relationship like he was supposed to be.",Should statements,

The thing is I have very little sexual drive, except when I’m on my period, have no inspiration or creativity(I used to be very artistic), and almost every day, no matter what part of my cycle I’m in, I have at least one angry melt down where something went wrong(like trying to flip an egg and it doesn’t flip right and the yolk breaks) and sometimes it happens multiple times a day. I actually avoid cooking eggs now because I suck at flipping them. These melt-downs rarely end in tears though. I just get really really mad and I feel my temperature rise. I kind of wish I could cry more actually, and I’m wondering if hard drug use in my teenage years has affected me, and is still affecting me 5 years later. I still have happy moments through-out the day. My days are just very up and down. I feel like I have no passion left except for anger and random ideas that I’ll never actually get around to or finish. I do notice the day before my period I have an ultra-meltdown that keeps getting worse. This last time I beat up my bed and tore everything out of my closet, scattering around the room. You know, I think I actually felt better when I was smoking and drinking coffee because now I’m completely sober, I’m fully aware of what’s going on in the world and I’m mad at the whole world. I feel the pain of the whole world and the Earth and I’d rather just hide in a cave with a bunch of pillows and blankets.","The thing is I have very little sexual drive, except when I’m on my period, have no inspiration or creativity(I used to be very artistic), and almost every day, no matter what part of my cycle I’m in, I have at least one angry melt down where something went wrong(like trying to flip an egg and it doesn’t flip right and the yolk breaks) and sometimes it happens multiple times a day.

"I’m wondering if anything is “wrong” with me. I don’t feel like there’s anything wrong with me. In fact, I feel pretty good. But…I really want to kill people, and I guess I think I probably shouldn’t. I have found some similar questions, but nothing that really answers my question. The main difference is that I don’t think I would really care on an emotional level if I killed anyone. The thought of actually going through with it doesn’t scare or distress me; quite the opposite, actually. I think it would be a lot of fun. The reason I think I shouldn’t is that I believe I would be more successful (whatever that means…) if I didn’t. Jail seems like a really boring place to be. I’ve felt bored for as long as I can remember. I like learning, or at least the idea of it, because I think having more information is good. Even learning is boring, though. I think it would be nice if it weren’t. Since I dislike being bored, and I imagine that jail would probably be even more boring that my life currently is, I’d rather not go to jail. There aren’t a lot of ways to research “killing without getting caught” so I figured I’d try to figure out how to not kill people instead. I’ve never actually killed anyone, if that matters. I’ve killed animals, and it was pretty nice, but never humans. I can’t quite describe why I want to kill. When I think about it, I feel like have a reason to live. I’ve never been suicidal, but I also feel detached, as if I am living my life just because I have nothing better to do. When I think about killing, that changes. I feel glad to be alive and I can’t wait act on the feelings. But I think I shouldn’t, and that’s why I’m submitting this question. So, how do I stop wanting to kill people? And is there something else that could make me feel the same way? I really like the feeling, and there isn’t much else that I like, so I don’t want to lose it.

"I have been dating my boyfriend for the past 7 months, and I am head over heels for him. He is about 14 years older than me and a college professor. This is part of our dilemma. He talks for a living. So when we are talking, he constantly interrupts me or asks me tons of questions without giving me the opportunity to answer any of them. It’s so frustrating. We both have strong personalities, so it has led to a couple of arguments. I started to do research into how we could communicate better, in an attempt to resolve the issue. 2 weeks ago, I confronted my boyfriend about the situation and told him that he chronically interrupts me or talks over me and how frustrating I found it. He got very defensive and told me that I was being passive aggressive and that I’m too sensitive. Since then our communication has dwindled. We used to talk on the phone every night and now we only talk on the phone a few times per week. I am freaking out a little here, because now there are awkward silences, or he throws in my face that he is letting me speak and that I should be grateful for the opportunity. I feel like this has put a huge wedge between us and it is deteriorating our relationship. We aren’t able to see a lot of each other as we both work long hours and he travels, so we need open communication in order to survive.

"I have PTSD, have been in a few abusive relationships, have over come them all and have always been fine.

"Your opinion? My partner is contradictory and critical, but at the same time gets very upset if any of her ideas or decisions are questioned in any way. Examples: She will ridicule any book I am reading unless it is one recommended by her. If it is not a subject that interests her, especially technical books, she will describe the book as childish rubbish. The same with any TV program or film. She is an aspirational vegetarian. If I have meat and she has vegetarian she has spent the evening — while I am eating — asking how I could eat dead rotting flesh, how do I feel having caused the death of  a living being just for my gratification etc. The following week she will buy, cook and eat chicken and say how tasty it is. Sex. This has now ceased. Very often she has not only rejected me, but says that I am disgusting for wanting sex, “Don’t come near me. Don’t you dare touch me”etc — almost hysterical. A couple of days later she will start crying and ask why don’t I make love to her any more, don’t I care for her? She will deny that she ever said that she did not want me near her. I thought that being nice to her would gain her trust and we would get closer. But it seems to have the opposite reaction. The nicer I am, the more awkward, contradictory and demanding she becomes. She seems to need to push me until we have a disagreement. My partner’s mother was English and her father Portuguese and she was brought up in Portugal. Her parents broke up when she was 10 and she ended up with her mother who did not spend much time with her as she had to work hard. With her job her mother was given a scholarship for her daughter to go to the local international school. My partner spent years there but never got on as her first language was not English. She felt very left out, not coming from a rich family. My partner has two older brothers and mentions her poor relationship with them when she was a child.

"About 5 years ago, I made a deal with my dad that I would try out 10 episodes of his favorite TV show because he really wanted me to try it. Then he said if I didn’t like it, I wouldn’t have to watch it anymore. I didn’t like it — sci-fi isn’t my genre. Anyway, my dad has asked a few times every year since then if I’ll try the show again, and I always say no and remind him I don’t like it. He says I didn’t give it a fair shot, and basically says anyone would like it. It involves some gory things like worms coming out of someone’s stomach, and I hate watching any violence or gory things. He tries to argue with me about why I’ll like it, but I’ve always hated sci-fi. I’ve offered to watch a show that we both like together. My dad has said multiple times “there’s no way you’re my daughter” or “you can’t be my daughter” since I hate sci-fi. I’m adamant against watching this show because I think he’s not respecting my answer and always wanted his kids to be interested in what he is interested in. He has tried to manipulate me by saying he would do what his father asked, and that if I’m so inflexible on this I’m bound to have problems in future relationships. He has said he doesn’t ask much of me. My dad has guilt-tripped me my whole life and has always been controlling. Maybe my resistance is partially coming from a huge history.

"Hi. I wanted to know if there could be something wrong with me, and if so, what could be causing it. For quite a while now I have been experiencing extremely intense mood swings and identity shifts that only last for a very short period of time. One minute I can feel suicidal, the next I feel euphoric, the next I am bursting with energy, the next I am rage full, and the next I feel like a rational human being. However, I have found that when I’m in these euphoric, energetic moods I can become extremely paranoid if triggered. The other night I slept over at my friend’s house in one of these moods, and the voices inside of my head said that if I didn’t throw my phone at the wall, something horrible would happen. So I struggled with it for a while, and then finally threw my phone at the wall. All my friends who were trying to go to sleep woke up. These voices are not audible they are just two voices that seem to be there and tell me to do things, but they contradict one another all the time, and often I can’t figure out who to trust. I’ve felt pretty stable for a little over a week now, except for last night when I thought that my mother was trying to poison me (lately I’ve been feeling more and more that my parents are trying to kill me). I had a small panic attack and then I got over it. I also started planning out how to kill my friend, but then changed my mind. I become very angry and murderous at times but still seem to have a capacity for intense empathy for others. The confusing thing is, whenever I switch back into my rational mode I view my past actions as ridiculous and try to forget about them. Rational mode can last for a week or so, maybe longer, and then I go back headlong into a tailspin and let everything fall apart. I know that I am not schizophrenic because these voices are not audible and I still have a pretty good grip on reality.

"My son came home from Colorado and has been drinking and smoking pot for about a year. When he came home he was a little paranoid but ok. He went to see some friends and partied for 3 days, he said he only drank. When he came home he was hearing voices and uncontrollable we took him to a hosp. and they admitted him and gave him some medication. He went into outpatient therapy, but that was not helping with his problems he needed one on one. We went to a social worker and she said he wanted to hurt himself so she called cops and had him admitted. He was there for 10 days because he did not want to take meds. He’s in outpatient again and the doctor has him on 1mg at night and 10mg Abilify. I cut the abilify to 5mg because when he was on 10mg he heard more voices and holding his head all the time and not functioning. The doctor still thinks he should be on 5mg in morning and 5mg towards evening. We tried that and the next day he was so bad we thought we were going to bring him to the hosp. again. I called the office and they said the dr. Knows what he is doing and I should listen to them. When I did not give him the extra Abilify yesterday he seemed much calmer and wanted to do something.

He is highly sensitive to sound and light and often complains about things being too loud and too bright. On occasion he also exhibits hand flapping and finger twisting. He has throughout his entire life shown little interest in me or my brother, in fact all he shows is anger. Furthermore I have noticed that he feels very awkward and uncomfortable around children, even his own grandchildren and at one point wouldn’t even go near them, talk to them or hold them when they were babies.

"Hello, I apologize if this appears jumbled, I feel there’s a lot I need to add! I would like to know whether these symptoms may be pointing towards Bipolar disorder. I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety about 6 years ago. Since then, I’ve gotten married, moved cities and went to university. I’ve also had periods of depression, and auditory hallucinations. During the past three years (noticed it more recently) I’ve been irritable, feeling high and low. Irritable, in the sense that I lash out at my husband for no reason. I just suddenly get angry — when he hasn’t done anything- and start shouting. After, I feel an immense sense of guilt and I will often break down in tears. Other times, I have these sorts of daydreams — but they feel more real than daydreams, if that makes sense. The best way I can describe it is I’ll get an idea in my head and I’ll get lost in it — it can range from anything, a recent example was the idea of being in a famous band. In reality, I couldn’t do such a thing due to being so timid. In this sense I also overestimate my abilities, in believing that I can get anything done just because.

From an 18 year old woman in the U.S.: I used to be a talkative outgoing person that would communicate with others and had the ability of making friends.

He is up and down, agreed to move back but still having issues with facing the area and the people.

"My husband’s uncle has great financial means however spends extremely little money on entertainment. He showed up unannounced for years often at supper hour and whenever he liked. After his girlfriend broke up with him his intrusions worsened.

His first response was “You don’t like me.” I am also sick with Lupus and when this first big argument came I was caring for several children.

She is a honest person, she wouldn’t ever cheat on someone, she hasn’t shown even once that she can do this to me, still I’m very jealous, we’ve had some arguments about that and she said that if I trusted her I wouldn’t worry, I do trust her really, but I don’t trust the guy or I just don’t feel it right to text so much with him or go out with him, I don’t think it’s right, I think he may like her even. And the problem is getting even more serious, I’m starting to get jealous when she goes out with her girl friends I start to overthink what she is doing, who is she texting and I’m so afraid of losing her. I have never felt another person so close to my heart as I feel her, I really don’t want to lose her. I haven’t told her I’m jealous of her girl friends because that would be ridiculous. I really want to keep our relationship healthy, but this is slowly becoming a huge problem which I need help to remove. Sometimes I am jealous that she has fun without me, I hide those feelings from her and I hold the pain in myself. I really hope that you understand my problem even tho my English isn’t that good and my problem is probably very strange. Please help me, I want to change. (age 16, from Bulgaria)",,No Distortion,
"From the U.S.: I’ve been diagnosed with OCD since summer of 2013 after I had 3 weeks of horrible intrusive thoughts, causing me to cry constantly. I started at 50mg of Zoloft, though soon I had to up it to 75mg then 100mg. I’ve been doing okay with the 100mg, though sometimes I forget to take it. The reason it all started (What I believe…) is after seeing the movie “The Conjuring.” It messed with me, made me afraid of possession or going crazy and hurting someone I love. I still am afraid of these things, but not as much. I haven’t watched any scary movies, but I’ve seen previews and they cause my anxiety to go out the roof. Its 11:17pm right now and I am tired but I’m not laying down because I am still afraid, except its slightly different. Lately, I’ve been feeling like someone is watching me, like a ghost (Lately, meaning in the past week this started.) and I don’t hear any voices or anything but I’m so afraid that I could be going crazy or something, it scares me so much. It may be because I haven’t been taking my Zoloft constantly, not that I ignore it, I honestly forget to take it. I went to my doctor last Monday and everything was okay, what should I do? Should I make another apt? I’ve also had therapy, it did help a lot. Should I go back to therapy? Please let me know, I want a professional opinion before I freak even more out. I’ve been reading too many things on the internet about “Am I insane? Am I crazy? Are ghost real? Am I being haunted?” Thank you.","Lately, I’ve been feeling like someone is watching me, like a ghost (Lately, meaning in the past week this started.) and I don’t hear any voices or anything but I’m so afraid that I could be going crazy or something, it scares me so much.

"I’m 14 years old, and I think I might have depression, but I’m not sure. On and off for the past year, I’ve been not motivated, and whenever I try to get organized or “Get my life together” it only lasts a few days. Yesterday I fell asleep at 8pm without doing my homework and woke up at 8am. I still felt exhausted, and my mom let me stay home because she thought I was sick, or upset about something. I told her I don’t know why I’m sad, but she thinks I just don’t want to tell her. I pretend to be happy most of the time, but I mostly just have an empty feeling.",,No Distortion,
"I’m asking for your help and I’m hopeful that you can point me in the right direction. The shape of my life is good, but there are lingering anxieties that have not resolved themselves in time. I’ve had the painful experience of being the target of bullying numerous times throughout my life. I’ve grown increasingly immune to bullying but unbeknownst to me a symptom has emerged. These episodes of bullying were traumatic but the most traumatic aspect was the breach of trust because the bullying came from friends and family. As such I experience social anxiety and emotionally stress. I am a heterosexual male, fairly honest, emphatic, and trustworthy but that has been put into question by bullies who attack my lack of manliness. I’m actually a good looking man who attracts women but that creates jealousy and unintentionally provokes bullying. The bullies project onto me their own insecurities. These include two highly controversial sexual preferences, one more so than the other. They are: homosexuality and pedophilia. It takes a higher level of emotional maturity to recognize that homosexuality is perfectly fine but pedophilia is a sexual disorder, distinct from child molestation which is a crime. In my opinion no one wants to be sick, so on one wants to be a pedophile nor depressed nor schizophrenic nor anxious, etc. People want to happy and healthy. I cannot cure those bullies with their insecurities and I cannot cure myself. I know the truth of who I am, but I sometimes feel anxious all the same. It rattled my bones. I use to become easily unnerved whenever homosexuality was discussed positively or negatively. Not so much these days. However, being bullied and told you’re a pedophile carries such a heavy social stigma that has taken longer to recover from. I should point out that I never had any issues with homosexuality and respected such preferences. I never had any issues being around children, and my brother asked me to be the godfather of his son because I was so responsible. I’ve lost sight of that. It has been forgotten due to social anxiety and emotional trauma. My question is simple. Should I seek professional help to rid myself of this cognitive dissonance or will it pass with time? My problem is I have become self-absorbed because of bullying, but I really want to reconnect with others.","However, being bullied and told you’re a pedophile carries such a heavy social stigma that has taken longer to recover from.

"I am very worried about my older brother. In the past 6 months he has started behaving very strangely. He has forged my name and my parents’ names on rental documents and doesn’t see anything wrong with it. Additionally, he is exhibiting very paranoid behavior, he gave away his cats, whom he loved for more than 5 years, and his reasoning is that my Dad is going to send him to jail! According to him he is an alcoholic, though I have never seen him drink more than 2 or 3 drinks at a sitting, and was prescribed medication from his therapist to stop drinking. He is paranoid, making bad decisions and is about to be evicted from his apartment. My whole family is at their wits end with him and we do not know what we can do! We don’t understand why he is taking meds for alcoholism when he isn’t an alcoholic or how he could be prescribed these without some sort of testing! He will say things that are completely outlandish and sometimes contradictory. We do not know what to do or where to turn. He will not tell us who is doctor is or what the meds are that he is taking! I am very worried that he is becoming a danger to himself and others. What can I do?",,No Distortion,

"Hi, I’m a 13 year old trans guy and I’ve just moved to a foreign country, I don’t speak the language. I’ve been feeling very depressed for over 6 months. Lately I’ve also been noticing how much anxiety I feel when doing things like going to school, talking to people, going to the store and generally going out of my house and socializing. I think people here dislike me and judge me all the time. But other than that, I’ve just been generally feeling very very sad all the time and I don’t know why.

"Since I can remember, I’ve always thought of myself as unattractive. At school I was considered undesirable and teased indirectly about my looks. In my later teens men started taking an interest and I became sexually active and happy, eventually entering my first relationship which lasted 4 years. This relationship ended about a year ago and though I am over it, my ex dragged out the ending and it became quite bitter with another woman involved. He would openly compare me to her and make comparisons and refused to kiss me but also would not end the relationship and have very unemotional sex with me – as though I were an object. He began making direct comments about my lack of attractiveness and eventually I left. A month or so after that, I slept with one man after a date in a dark room. Since then, I have been unable to be naked around myself or others. I cannot look at myself in the mirror and my sex life has completely stopped as I can’t be intimate unless the room is pitch black, I have clothes on and I don’t know the guy. It’s been almost a year since I last had any sexual contact with anyone and it’s upsetting me greatly. I worry I won’t ever be able to be naked or intimate with anyone again. The problem has progressed – I have always been nervous of spending time with just one person unless I know them extremely well as I fear awkward silences or general awkwardness. This has merged with my inability to have sex as I also fear being alone with someone I intend to have sex with: what would I say? What do we talk about? What if there is nothing to talk about? I miss being intimate with others and there have been multiple times I could have engaged in sexual activity or perhaps formed a relationship on one occasion but I can’t discuss this issue with anyone other than close friends and the distress it causes me knowing I won’t be able to have sex leads me to push potential sexual partners away. I decided to seek help on here after tonight, 2 separate men I know I can speak to alone, came to my room to ask if I’d like to sleep with them and both times I panicked and was unable.

"I feel overprotective about my mother because of the fact that I lost my grandparents almost 2 years ago. Since my maternal grandparents’ deaths a year and a half ago, I have been over-protective about my mother. I loved my grandparents very much. Both passed away at a month’s interval and it came as a shock to my mother as well as me. Since then, whenever my mother is out alone, I become hysterical. I constantly ask her not to go out alone, in the fear of losing her. I get so worried whenever she is sick or just catches a minor cold. My dad and I were never that close. I tried telling him how I feel but he dismissed it. When my mother is out alone, I keep on thinking what if something happens to her while she is on the road. I imagine all possible situations and I end up having crying spells. All throughout those hours I fail to concentrate on anything productive. I even discarded the idea of studying outside my State. I’m sure my dad won’t be able to take good care of her. And without mum I don’t even know how I’ll go on. I can’t even imagine a second not knowing if she’s OK. I don’t know if this over-protectiveness is good or bad. But I get the feeling that I keep losing everyone I love. (From India)","Since then, whenever my mother is out alone, I become hysterical.

"Hi, for about 3 years now I have been feeling low on and off, sometimes I’m fine, then sometimes I feel really irritable/angry/low. I just flip, out of nowhere sometimes. I depend on alcohol when this happens as I feel it relaxes me, I know this isn’t the right way of dealing with things, but it definitely helps. I shut off friends during these episodes. I have been to see a counselor recently, but felt really stupid, couldn’t speak to her and cancelled the rest of the sessions. I was emotionally and physically bullied by someone who was close to me when i was younger.

Due to financial issues I had been forced to move to my hometown with my family but without my father. During my first year here I had been severely depressed. At times I was highly tempted to cut my arms or simply climb up to the roof and jump but luckily I refused to do either. During this time I refused to speak to anyone and I had noticeably started spending more time with my online ‘friends’.
