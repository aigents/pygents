a real-life	1.0
an obstacle	1.0
maybe it’s	1.0
learned when	1.0
complex for	1.0
was part	1.0
in theory	1.0
having this	1.0
express them	1.0
run from	1.0
it’s too	1.0
from feelings	1.0
comprehend them	1.0
or others	1.0
get confused	1.0
i don´t	1.0
too complex	1.0
don´t seem	1.0

i didn´t	1.0
someone from	1.0
obstacle i	1.0
initially i	1.0
usually see	1.0
a more	1.0
such ease	1.0
from portugal	1.0
them so	1.0
odd because	1.0
happiness etc	1.0
why people	1.0
me which	1.0
people express	1.0
so easily	1.0
are but when	1.0
because other people	1.0
few years that	1.0
can’t run from	1.0
such ease maybe	1.0
and feelings that	1.0
understand feelings i	1.0
but it’s too	1.0
and frustrated i	1.0
or others i	1.0
don´t seem to	1.0
complex for me	1.0
more logical manner	1.0
my personality however	1.0
a skill that	1.0
frustrated i have	1.0
i don´t seem	1.0
tell someone from	1.0
i can’t understand	1.0
happening i get	1.0
it’s a skill	1.0
have learned when	1.0
problem for a	1.0
put it together	1.0
i didn´t think	1.0
i tell someone	1.0
was bad i	1.0
world in a	1.0
that much i	1.0
so easily for	1.0
situation occurs with	1.0
with such ease	1.0
can’t understand them	1.0
have emotions and	1.0
together but it’s	1.0
them or understand	1.0
it’s too complex	1.0
it was part	1.0
in theory what	1.0
comprehend them so	1.0
when an emotional	1.0
me comprehend them	1.0
like but in	1.0
me or others	1.0
interpret them or	1.0
just thought it	1.0
obstacle i don´t	1.0
confused and frustrated	1.0
have to interpret	1.0
them with such	1.0
around me comprehend	1.0
usually see the	1.0
happiness etc looks	1.0
however i have	1.0
other people around	1.0
or why people	1.0
logical manner as	1.0
why they are	1.0
occurs with me	1.0
i know how	1.0
it together but	1.0
why people express	1.0
seen for a	1.0
and when an	1.0
feelings that much	1.0
express them with	1.0
much i know	1.0
learned when i	1.0
feelings i know	1.0
run from feelings	1.0
i get confused	1.0
know how anger	1.0
get confused and	1.0
others i try	1.0
know in theory	1.0
someone from portugal	1.0
didn´t think it	1.0
was part of	1.0
anger happiness etc	1.0
manner as much	1.0
but in a	1.0
example i know	1.0
initially i didn´t	1.0
etc looks like	1.0
try to put	1.0
from feelings and	1.0
maybe it’s a	1.0
people express them	1.0
been having this	1.0
how anger happiness	1.0
situation i can’t	1.0
i usually see	1.0
theory what they	1.0
understand why they	1.0
emotional situation occurs	1.0
for me which	1.0
in a more	1.0
should have learned	1.0
have seen for	1.0
know i usually	1.0
easily for example	1.0
having this problem	1.0
odd because other	1.0
they are happening	1.0
of my personality	1.0
while initially i	1.0
bad i just	1.0
or understand why	1.0
a kid should	1.0
personality however i	1.0
to understand feelings	1.0
years that it	1.0
them so easily	1.0
looks like but	1.0
skill that i	1.0
i have emotions	1.0
is an obstacle	1.0
are happening i	1.0
understand them or	1.0
a more logical	1.0
emotions and feelings	1.0
kid should i	1.0
ease maybe it’s	1.0
me which i	1.0
a while initially	1.0
they are but	1.0
real-life situation i	1.0
an emotional situation	1.0
in a real-life	1.0
feelings and when	1.0
to interpret them	1.0

also another	1.0
woman the	1.0
so anyways	1.0
scene where	1.0
relevant is	1.0
could relate	1.0
another aspect	1.0
i deserved	1.0
injury off	1.0
young maybe	1.0
is is	1.0
scene didn’t	1.0
stories and	1.0
word when	1.0
of anticipation	1.0
that talk	1.0
and curious	1.0
knee and	1.0
be relevant	1.0
became engrossed	1.0
think may	1.0
anyways ever	1.0
really mean	1.0
mother perpetrate	1.0
home but	1.0
hawaii and	1.0
i witnessed	1.0
like just	1.0
the lake	1.0
me excited	1.0
sound spanking	1.0
sights that	1.0
the dd	1.0
spanking was	1.0
where elvis	1.0
disciplined by	1.0
was broached	1.0
this scene	1.0
broached i	1.0
takes this	1.0
not include	1.0
or reading	1.0
self injury	1.0
spanking this	1.0
blue hawaii	1.0
just hearing	1.0
by driving	1.0
deserved one	1.0
relate spanking	1.0
this girl	1.0
of spanking	1.0
started looking	1.0
hearing or	1.0
anyways after	1.0
led me	1.0
spanking needs	1.0
couldn’t be	1.0
real issue	1.0
and decided	1.0
his knee	1.0
did so	1.0
needs but	1.0
adult spanking	1.0
my spanking	1.0
my desire	1.0
girl over	1.0
spanking to	1.0
witnessed my	1.0
herself by	1.0
abuse that	1.0
my mate	1.0
healthy expression	1.0
better word	1.0
that somehow	1.0
intrigued and	1.0
domestic discipline	1.0
spanking in	1.0
spank a	1.0
maybe or	1.0
mean young	1.0
lake when	1.0
maybe or i	1.0
struggled with self	1.0
include me getting	1.0
wondering if that	1.0
the internet that	1.0
really intrigued and	1.0
did so anyways	1.0
i have struggled	1.0
word made me	1.0
hearing or reading	1.0
adult spanking this	1.0
decided that i	1.0
i think may	1.0
elvis takes this	1.0
relationship i became	1.0
think may be	1.0
to was the	1.0
full grown woman	1.0
like just hearing	1.0
by my mate	1.0
in 8th grade	1.0
grown woman the	1.0
dd stories and	1.0
over his knee	1.0
witnessed my mother	1.0
i couldn’t be	1.0
that had to	1.0
scene didn’t seem	1.0
reading the word	1.0
intrigued and curious	1.0
kill herself by	1.0
could relate spanking	1.0
to the domestic	1.0
mom did so	1.0
guess is is	1.0
and decided that	1.0
all the dd	1.0
with adult spanking	1.0
in my home	1.0
the word made	1.0
the dd stories	1.0
spanking when i	1.0
be relevant is	1.0
say the least	1.0
and on for	1.0
i saw that	1.0
about spanking in	1.0
aspect that i	1.0
of anticipation like	1.0
a full grown	1.0
young woman anyways	1.0
and spanks her	1.0
where elvis takes	1.0
one also another	1.0
if that somehow	1.0
needs but the	1.0
was young maybe	1.0
a relationship that	1.0
his knee and	1.0
woman the only	1.0
engrossed to say	1.0
spanking was broached	1.0
or reading the	1.0
knee and spanks	1.0
guess i really	1.0
but the real	1.0
this scene where	1.0
i deserved one	1.0
blue hawaii and	1.0
spanking in a	1.0
of spanking was	1.0
topic of spanking	1.0
into the lake	1.0
internet that had	1.0
was in 8th	1.0
i became engrossed	1.0
least i read	1.0
i guess is	1.0
this scene didn’t	1.0
the real issue	1.0
i really mean	1.0
man spank a	1.0
me excited for	1.0
home but this	1.0
when i deserved	1.0
excited for lack	1.0
of a better	1.0
better word when	1.0
every time the	1.0
the least i	1.0
have struggled with	1.0
is this scene	1.0
and curious i	1.0
couldn’t be in	1.0
not include me	1.0
be disciplined by	1.0
started looking at	1.0
seen a man	1.0
years i was	1.0
my spanking needs	1.0
watching blue hawaii	1.0
the domestic discipline	1.0
got this feeling	1.0
a healthy expression	1.0
feeling of anticipation	1.0
talk about spanking	1.0
a sound spanking	1.0
time the topic	1.0
anyways ever since	1.0
the lake when	1.0
spanking to was	1.0
this a healthy	1.0
girl over his	1.0
curious i had	1.0
on for years	1.0
didn’t seem like	1.0
that i couldn’t	1.0
but this scene	1.0
that somehow correlates	1.0
with self injury	1.0
correlates with my	1.0
also another aspect	1.0
healthy expression is	1.0
because she tried	1.0
deserved one also	1.0
domestic discipline sights	1.0
lake when i	1.0
takes this girl	1.0
word when i	1.0
became engrossed to	1.0
to be disciplined	1.0
herself by driving	1.0
i started looking	1.0
was really intrigued	1.0
the abuse that	1.0
thing i could	1.0
this led me	1.0
relevant is the	1.0
just hearing or	1.0
seem like what	1.0
i got this	1.0
self injury off	1.0
after that every	1.0
my mom did	1.0
expression is there	1.0
looking at things	1.0
to say the	1.0
issue i guess	1.0
that scene i	1.0
my mother perpetrate	1.0

broached i got	1.0
that i witnessed	1.0
saw that scene	1.0
grade i started	1.0
with my desire	1.0

rather than living	1.0
have the opinion	1.0
several years down	1.0
down the track	1.0
somehow has a	1.0
can be used	1.0
the opinion of	1.0
be better to	1.0
their life sitting	1.0
this and wouldn’t	1.0
excessive need for	1.0

truly see me	1.0
may have dp	1.0
puppet and my	1.0
really am the	1.0
like strangers i	1.0
create the symptoms	1.0
with the feelings	1.0
dp was and	1.0
a moment i	1.0
truly knows the	1.0
never can see	1.0
even can recognize	1.0
reason i will	1.0
want people to	1.0
this happens randomly	1.0
get a moment	1.0

remorse for hurting	1.0
kill him that	1.0
never met his	1.0
say that he	1.0
so i asked	1.0
